2012-01-06,https://www.reuters.com,TEXT-Fitch rates HPCL-Mittal Energy's NCD at 'Fitch AA-(ind)',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) June 01 - Fitch Ratings has assigned HPCL-Mittal Energy Limited’s (HMEL) INR5bn secured non-convertible debenture (NCD) programme a rating of ‘Fitch AA-(ind)’. These debentures are secured in nature with a 4% coupon rate and significant premium on maturity. The proceeds of the NCD issue will be used to prepay a part of existing rupee term loans thus preventing interest outgo and alleviating liquidity pressure on the company during initial years. HMEL’s ratings reflect its sponsors’ (Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited  (HPCL, ‘Fitch AAA(ind)’/Stable) and Mittal Energy Investment Pte Ltd (MEIL)) strength. The ratings are underpinned by HMEL’s support agreement with the sponsors to maintain a minimum shareholding of 51% until the term loans are fully repaid and to fund project cost overruns as of end-March 2012. HMEL is also entitled to receive various fiscal and non-fiscal benefits from the government of Punjab by virtue of its refinery being located in the state. The ratings also benefit from the high refinery complexity of 12.6 on Nelson Complexity Index, which would enable HMEL to command high refining margins. The ratings have been notched up to reflect the existence of HMEL’s firm ‘take-or-pay’ product off-take agreement with HPCL for the evacuation of produced liquids (about 80% of the total production) and the former’s strong operational linkages with, and strategic importance to, the latter. Fitch notes that HMEL’s liquid output will fulfill the refined products requirements of HPCL’s distribution network in the northern India, increasing the latter’s downstream integration. Also, HMEL expects significant freight advantages for its refinery compared with the refineries located in the western India, as both its production facility and end-markets would be located in northern India. HMEL also has long-term agreements with various other industrial users and cement manufacturers for the supply of polypropylene and pet-coke, which also form a significant part of its solids product slate. However, volatile gross refinery margins along with operational challenges in ramping up the production at its recently commissioned refinery could impact its profitability and debt servicing capability. Moreover, the projected overcapacity in polypropylene would expose the company to over-supply risks and pricing pressures in this product segment. Negative rating action may result from a failure to ramp-up operations as planned leading to delayed de-leveraging. Moreover, any weakening of HMEL’s linkages with the sponsors or significant deterioration in HPCL’s credit profile could impact the ratings negatively. While consolidated financial leverage (net debt/EBIDTA) of below 3x over the medium term could act as positive rating factor. HMEL is a JV between HPCL and MEIL, each with a 49% stake; the rest 2% is held by Industrial Finance Corporation of India (1.2%) and State Bank of India (0.8%). HMEL’s wholly owned subsidiary, HPCL-Mittal Pipelines Limited (‘Fitch AA-(ind)’/Stable) - has set up a dedicated crude oil receipt and storage facility in Gujarat and a 1,017 km cross-country pipeline for the transportation of crude oil to HMEL’s refinery. HMEL’s outstanding ratings (including the above) are as follows: - National Long-Term Rating: ‘Fitch AA-(ind)’/Stable - INR80.98bn term loans: ‘Fitch AA-(ind)’ - INR30bn fund-based working capital limits: ‘Fitch AA-(ind)’/‘Fitch A1+(ind)’ - INR20bn non-fund-based working capital limits: ‘Fitch AA-(ind)’/‘Fitch A1+(ind)’ - INR15bn commercial paper programme (within fund-based working capital limits): ‘Fitch A1+(ind)’ - INR5bn NCD programme: ‘Fitch AA-(ind)’Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
2012-01-30,https://www.reuters.com,TEXT-Fitch ups HPCL-Mittal Energy to 'Fitch AA-(ind)'/Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Jan 30 - Fitch Ratings has upgraded India-based HPCL-Mittal Energy Limited’s (HMEL) National Long-Term rating to ‘Fitch AA-(ind)’ from ‘Fitch A+(ind)’. The Outlook is Stable. A list of additional rating actions is provided below. The upgrade reflects the timely completion of HMEL’s, 9 MMTPA greenfield 	 refinery without any significant cost over runs. The crude distillation and 	 allied units along with the power plant were commissioned in September 2011; and 	 the refinery has started commercial sales. HMEL has earlier replaced a part of 	 its original rupee loans of INR77.9bn with external commercial borrowings. In 	 October 2011, the entire rupee component of the borrowings was refinanced by the 	 company, at which time the estimated project cost was INR142.9bn. This has 	 resulted in lower interest costs to the tune of INR1.4bn besides incorporating a 	 step-up repayment mechanism. Fitch notes that this would likely ease pressure on 	 HMEL’s cash flows during initial years. The ratings reflect sponsor strength, underpinned by a support agreement to 	 maintain a minimum shareholding of 51% until the term loans are fully repaid and 	 to provide financial support for project cost overruns as estimated on end-March 	 2012. The refinery is also entitled to receive various fiscal and non-fiscal 	 benefits from the Government of Punjab. The ratings also benefit from the high 	 refinery complexity of 12.6 on Nelson Complexity Index, which would enable it to 	 command higher refining margins.

2012-02-13,https://www.reuters.com,"QP, Qapco to build $5 bln petchem complex","* Will produce petrochemicals for markets abroad * Will be operational by 2018 DOHA, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum and Qatar Petrochemical Co (QAPCO) will build a $5 billion petrochemical complex in the Gulf Arab state, the companies said on Monday. The plant, to be located at Qatar’s Ras Laffan industrial city, will produce petrochemical products mainly to be sold to high-growth markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America, the country’s energy minister Mohammed Al-Sada said at the signing ceremony on Monday. The plant, which will include a steam cracker, will produce 1.4 million tonnes per annum of ethylene, 850,000 tonnes per annum of high-density polyethylene, 430,000 of linear low-density polyethylene, 760,000 tonnes per annum of polypropylene and 83,000 tonnes per annum of butadiene. It will be jointly developed by QP and QAPCO and will be operational by 2018, Sada said. “It will be a valuable contributor to our future GDP growth,” the minister said. QAPCO is jointly owned by Industries Qatar with an 80 percent stake and France’s Total with a 20 percent stake. Qatar plans to spend $25 billion on expanding its domestic petrochemical industry over the next decade and will more than double its annual petchem production capacity from 9.2 million tonnes now to 23 million tonnes by 2020, Sada said last month. QP’s international arm Qatar Petroleum International recently formed a joint venture with Petrovietnam to build the $4-billion Long Son petrochemical project in Vietnam. In December Qatar signed a deal with Royal Dutch Shell  to develop a $6.4 billion petrochemicals complex, also at Ras Laffan. The plant will have the capacity to produce 1.5 million tonnes of mono-ethylene glycol per year and 300,000 tonnes of linear alpha olefin, mostly for export to Asian markets. Sada said at the time plans for additional petrochemical plants in Qatar were in the pipeline.

2012-02-23,https://www.reuters.com,TEXT: Stationery Point India Rated at 'Fitch BB(ind)'/Stable,"(The following was released by the rating agency) MUMBAI/SINGAPORE, February 23 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Stationery Point India Limited (SPIL) a National Long-Term rating of ‘Fitch BB(ind)’ with Stable Outlook. A list of additional rating actions is provided at the end of this commentary. The ratings reflect SPIL’s near-full utilisation (around 95%) of its working capital facilities during September 2011-January 2012 due to its high working capital requirements as the company is offered a limited credit period from its suppliers. The ratings also reflect the INR629.5m corporate guarantee extended by SPIL to its group companies, namely Shivani Flexipack and S.K. Agrotech. The ratings are constrained by SPIL’s small scale of operations that offers limited bargaining power with suppliers and volatile operating margins due to intense competition and unstable raw material prices (mainly polyester, polyethylene and polypropylene). The latter accounts for around 41% of cost of goods sold. However, revenues have grown significantly at a CAGR of 42.6% over the last three years to INR2,327m in FY11 (financial year ending September), with EBIDTA margins increasing to 14.2% (FY08: 8.8%). This was because the company launched high value-added products in its flexible packaging segment in FY11. SPIL’s ratings also reflect the more than a decade-long experience of its founders in the domestic packaging industry and its strong established relationship with its clients. Negative rating guidelines include higher-than-expected working capital requirements and total adjusted net debt/EBITDA exceeding 5.0x on a sustained basis. Positive rating guidelines include a consistent demonstration of improved working capital management and a total adjusted net debt/EBITDAR of below 3.5x on a sustained basis. Incorporated in 1999, SPIL manufactures flexible packaging products (86% of FY11 total revenues), paper products and wire products at a capacity of 10,600 TPA, 2,000 TPA and 1,125 TPA, respectively, at Kaledhon, District Satara. For FY11, the company’s total debt stood at INR1,375m, which included the corporate guarantees to group companies, and financial leverage (total adjusted net debt/EBITDA) was 4.2x. Fitch has also assigned ratings to SPIL’s bank loans as follows: - INR450m working capital cash credit limits: assigned ‘Fitch BB(ind)’ - INR140.8m O/S term loans as on September 2011: assigned ‘Fitch BB(ind)’ - INR29.5m non-fund based working capital limits: assigned ‘Fitch A4+(ind)’Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

2012-03-15,https://www.reuters.com,TEXT-S&P raises Gundle/SLT Environmental to 'B',"March 15 - Overview	
     -- U.S. geosynthetic liner producer Gundle/SLT Environmental Inc. (GSE) 	
has successfully completed its IPO. The company used a significant portion of 	
the proceeds to reduce debt.	
     -- We are removing our ratings on GSE from CreditWatch and raising our 	
corporate credit rating to 'B'.	
     -- We are assigning a stable outlook, which incorporates our expectation 	
of solid end-market demand and operating performance despite high material 	
costs, with the company's funds from operations to adjusted debt ratio 	
remaining near 15%.	
	
Rating Action	
On March 15, 2012, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services removed its ratings on 	
Houston-based Gundle/SLT Environmental Inc. (GSE) from CreditWatch, where we 	
placed them with positive implications on Nov. 30, 2011, after the company 	
announced its IPO filing. We then raised our corporate credit rating on GSE by 	
one notch to 'B' from 'B-'. The outlook is stable.	
	
We also raised our issue ratings on the company's senior secured debt to 'B' 	
(same as the corporate credit rating) from 'B-'. The recovery rating remains 	
'3', indicating our expectation of meaningful (50% to 70%) recovery in the 	
event of a default. We raised our issue rating on the company's second-lien 	
debt to 'B-' (one notch lower than the corporate credit rating) from 'CCC+'. 	
The recovery rating remains '5', indicating our expectation of modest (10% to 	
30%) recovery in the event of a default.	
	
Rationale	
These rating actions follow the company's successful completion of its IPO and 	
use of a significant portion of the proceeds to repay debt, including a $20 	
million prepayment on its senior secured second-lien notes. As a result, the 	
company's financial risk profile has improved: GSE's pro forma total adjusted 	
debt to EBITDA ratio as of Sept. 30, 2011, was 3.7x compared with 5.1x in the 	
same period before the IPO and debt reduction.	
	
The corporate credit rating on GSE reflects our view of the company's business 	
risk as ""fair"" and its financial risk as ""aggressive"" (as our criteria define 	
the terms). We believe that solid demand from GSE's mining, solid waste 	
management, and liquid containment end markets will continue over the next 	
year and that and that the company could establish a track record of steady 	
improvement in revenue, earnings, and cash flow.	
	
With annual sales of about $465 million, GSE is one of the largest 	
participants in the global geosynthetics market. The company is a global 	
producer of geomembrane liners, with applications in solid waste containment 	
(about 37% of total sales), mining (28%), environmental containment (16%), 	
liquid containment (16%), hazardous waste (2%), and other (1%). GSE derives 	
more than 60% of its sales from non-U.S. markets, though some customer 	
concentration partially offsets this geographic diversity; its top 10 	
customers account for about 25% of revenues. The geomembrane market is price 	
competitive and has modest barriers to entry, including the ability to 	
navigate government regulation, the need to establish good customer 	
relationships, and the high replacement cost of production lines and 	
operations. GSE's competitors include privately owned regional companies.	
	
The company makes its products primarily from polyethylene and polypropylene 	
resins, which are used to form geosynthetic containment systems for landfills 	
and other applications to prevent groundwater contamination as well as for the 	
confinement of water, industrial liquids, solids, and gases. Price, quality of 	
products and services, and distribution capabilities are the key competitive 	
factors in the geomembrane market. Raw materials, mainly consisting of plastic 	
resins derived from oil and natural gas, account for about 80% of the cost of 	
sales, having risen because of high petrochemical prices. This factor raises 	
concern because rapid increases in raw material prices pressure profitability 	
and liquidity, particularly when sales volumes are depressed. Although the 	
company's backlog and order flow have improved from prior years, the company's 	
business is dependent on the timing and activity of projects in mining and 	
landfill construction/expansion, which are less predictable than other 	
environmental services.	
	
GSE's profitability is weaker than those of other environmental services 	
companies, with a trailing-12-month EBITDA margin of 9% as of Sept. 30, 2011. 	
However, this has improved swiftly from 4% during mid-2010. The company has 	
benefitted from higher volume shipments and a more-profitable product mix. 	
During the past year and a half, GSE has improved its ability to 	
cost-effectively procure raw materials despite the steady increases in 	
polyethylene costs. The company also has cut costs by reducing employee 	
headcount, divesting its high-cost North American installation business, and 	
shutting down an underperforming manufacturing facility in the U.K. GSE's 	
pricing initiatives have taken effect, and international sales are robust with 	
higher volumes sold to China, Australia, and India. The increase in shale gas 	
hydraulic fracturing activity and the associated lining of the disposal ponds 	
that contain flowback water could also stimulate demand for GSE's products. 	
The potential regulation of coal ash disposal could also boost GSE's sales, 	
but this does not appear to us to be likely any time soon.	
	
In the near term, we expect that GSE will perform similarly to recent trends, 	
assuming end-market demand continues to gradually improve with economic 	
activity and raw material price movements remain manageable. Our 2012 	
performance expectations include:	
	
     -- Sales growth of about 6%, mainly due to higher volumes shipped, 	
improved product mix, and pricing gains;	
     -- Moderate increases in the costs of polyethylene resins;	
     -- Stable-to-slightly increasing operating margins on operating leverage 	
and cost containment; and	
     -- EBITDA of roughly $45 million in 2012.	
	
We characterize GSE's financial risk as ""aggressive"" under our criteria. The 	
company completed its IPO in February 2012, using more than $50 million of the 	
proceeds to reduce debt: repaying $20 million of its $40 million second-lien 	
notes due November 2016. Still, roughly 56% of its equity remains in the hands 	
of equity sponsor CHS Capital (formerly known as Code Hennessy & Simmons), 	
which has been investing in the company since 2004. As of Sept. 30, 2011, 	
GSE's pro forma total adjusted debt to EBITDA was 3.7x, while its funds from 	
operations (FFO) to debt ratio was 15% (we adjust debt balances to incorporate 	
self-insurance reserves and accrued interest). While these credit measures 	
represent substantial improvement, free cash generation remains inconsistent, 	
and we expect it to have been slightly negative in 2011 following the negative 	
$30 million in 2010 and positive $44 million in 2009. This inconsistent cash 	
flow, attributable mainly to working capital swings and resin price 	
fluctuations, reflects the volatility inherent in GSE's operations.	
	
Liquidity	
We believe GSE will have ""adequate"" sources of liquidity to cover its needs in 	
the coming months, even if EBITDA were to unexpectedly decline. Pro forma for 	
the IPO, we estimate the company to have more than $20 million in cash on its 	
balance sheet, with about $30 million of availability under a $35 million cash 	
flow revolving facility due May 27, 2016. We believe debt maturities are 	
manageable--the senior secured term loans mature in May and November 2016, 	
with $1.35 million of annual amortization requirements. We estimate sources of 	
liquidity for the next 12 months of about $50 million, mainly consisting of 	
FFO and availability under the credit facility. We estimate that GSE will use 	
roughly $35 million during the same period for working capital needs, capital 	
expenditures, tuck-in acquisitions, and debt amortization. Working capital 	
swings tend to be significant; typically, a midyear ramp-up in working capital 	
results in significantly negative free cash flow generation during the second 	
quarter of each year, with a liquidity trough near the end of the third 	
quarter. We expect the high working capital usage to reverse in the second 	
half of the year.	
	
We estimate that GSE's capital expenditures will rise above $15 million in 	
2012 because of growth-related investments in capacity, though we note that 	
maintenance capital expenditures are less than $5 million.	
	
Our assessment of GSE's liquidity profile incorporates the following 	
expectations and assumptions:	
     -- Sources of liquidity, including cash and facility availability, will 	
exceed uses by 1.2x or more over the next 12-18 months;	
     -- Net sources will remain positive, even if EBITDA declines more than 	
15%; and	
     -- Compliance with financial covenants could survive a 20% drop in 	
EBITDA, in our view.	
	
Financial covenants in GSE's credit facility include a maximum leverage ratio, 	
a minimum interest coverage ratio, and a maximum level of capital 	
expenditures. GSE was in compliance with its financial covenants as of Sept. 	
30, 2011, with sufficient EBITDA headroom under its maximum leverage and 	
interest coverage ratios. We expect the company to have been compliant at 	
year-end 2011 as well, with similar levels of headroom.	
	
Recovery analysis	
For the complete recovery analysis, see our recovery report on Gundle/SLT 	
Environmental, to be published later on RatingsDirect.	
	
Outlook	
The stable outlook reflects our view that GSE's end-market demand will 	
continue to be solid and its operating performance will offset high raw 	
material costs. Over the next year, we expect the company to benefit from 	
gradual economic recovery, resulting in growth in revenue, earnings, and cash 	
flow. The company's liquidity is adequate and its debt maturity profile is 	
manageable, with no major maturities until 2016. We could raise ratings if GSE 	
sustains its recent improvement in profitability over the next few quarters 	
and if it generates FFO to debt that continually exceeds the 10% to 15% range 	
that we expect for the current ratings. On the other hand, we could lower the 	
ratings if unexpected rises in raw material prices or weak demand cause 	
covenant headroom and liquidity to erode meaningfully. We estimate that if 	
revenues remain flat and operating margins decline by roughly 170 basis 	
points, then the level of headroom could become tight enough to warrant a 	
downgrade.

2012-03-19,https://www.reuters.com,"S&P Affirms Braskem 'bbb-' Glbl Scale, 'braaa' Natl Scale Rtgs","(The following statement was released by the rating agency)	
    March 19 (Reuters) - Overview	
     -- Brazil-based petrochemical company Braskem's business profile, 	
including its strong market position and adequate feedstock supply, have 	
sustained the ratings despite a challenging Brazilian petrochemicals industry 	
in 2011.	
     -- We are affirming our ratings, including the 'BBB-' global scale and 	
'brAAA' national scale corporate credit ratings, on the company.	
     -- The stable outlook reflects the company's strong liquidity and our 	
expectation that margins will recover with the start-up of capacity expansions.	
	
	
Rating Action	
On March 19, 2012, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services affirmed its global 	
scale ratings, including the 'BBB-' corporate credit rating, on Brazil-based 	
petrochemical company Braskem S.A. At the same time, we affirmed our Brazilian 	
national scale rating on the company at 'brAAA'. The outlooks remained stable.	
	
Rationale	
Standard & Poor's ratings on Braskem reflect the strengths of its business 	
profile, based on its dominant market position, diversified feedstock, and 	
favorable supply contracts. Despite weaker operating performance in 2011, 	
caused by growth deceleration, import competition, and lower thermoplastic 	
resin prices, Braskem maintains strong liquidity. Nonetheless, Braskem is 	
exposed to industry cyclicality, currently worse global market conditions, 	
more-volatile commodity prices, and fluctuating exchange rates.	
	
Braskem's business profile is ""satisfactory,"" as our criteria define it. 	
Despite fierce competition from imports, the company benefits from a dominant 	
position in the Brazilian petrochemicals market as the sole local producer of 	
polyethylene and polypropylene, and a leading player in polyvinyl chloride 	
(PVC). Its feedstock contracts with Petrobras, close commercial relationships 	
with its fragmented customer base, and strong distribution capabilities allow 	
Braskem to sell products at adequate margins even under severe competitive 	
pressure. As the leading producer of thermoplastic resins in the Americas and 	
No. 8 worldwide, Braskem's total capacity amounts to 7.5 million tons 	
distributed in 35 facilities, mainly in Brazil and the U.S. The company's size 	
and diverse client base bring it more resilient performance even under more 	
uncertain market conditions, both domestically and abroad, and more-volatile 	
petrochemical prices. We believe a more-balanced feedstock mix among naphtha 	
and ethane, high flexibility to plan production efficiently at its several 	
plants, economies of scope and scale, and operating synergies will help the 	
company weather these uncertainties and, potentially, a longer market downturn.	
	
Braskem's financial profile weakened in 2011 but is still ""significant."" 	
Although Braskem managed to improve the 2011 operating performance of acquired 	
Quattor S.A. (not rated) by increasing capacity utilization at Quattor's 	
plants, its EBITDA margin decreased to 11% on lower thermoplastic resin prices 	
in the second half of the year. Overall lower capacity utilization because of 	
maintenance shutdowns in Triunfo and Camacari, along with a temporary blackout 	
in Camacari, also affected results. These factors, coupled with negative 	
currency trends in the fourth quarter, caused the company's adjusted total 	
debt to EBITDA to spike to 4.7x, significantly higher than we had expected, by 	
year-end. However, we expect that Braskem will improve its credit metrics on 	
stronger cash flows in 2012, increasing dollar-denominated revenues and 	
therefore profits because the average exchange rate is more favorable. We 	
further expect to see higher capacity utilization and greater volumes from the 	
consolidation of acquired Dow plants in the U.S. and the completion of PVC and 	
butadiene expansion projects in Brazil. By year-end 2012, adjusted total debt 	
to EBITDA will likely decline to 3.8x, which we view as more commensurate with 	
the rating.	
	
Liquidity	
Braskem's liquidity is ""strong."" In December 2011, the company reported sound 	
cash reserves of Brazilian reais (R$) 3.2 billion, compared with short-term 	
debt of R$1.4 billion. Our opinion reflects several assumptions:	
	
     -- Liquidity sources (including cash on hand, discretionary cash flow, 	
and availability under the company's credit facility) exceeding cash uses 	
(including working capital needs, capital expenditures, and short-term debt) 	
by 1.8x in 2012;	
     -- Liquidity sources continuing to exceed uses, even if EBITDA were to 	
decline by 30%;	
     -- Capital expenditures remaining manageable, even when including 	
investments in greenfield projects in Mexico;	
     -- Braskem continuing to manage its working capital efficiently, 	
resulting in low financing needs in the intermediate term; and	
     -- Strong covenant headroom, amounting to 40% of the firm's EBITDA based 	
on net debt ratios in U.S. dollars.	
	
Outlook	
The stable outlook reflects our expectation that operating results will 	
improve as capacity utilization increases and prices, as measured in local 	
currency, recover throughout 2012. We project a decrease in adjusted total 	
debt to EBITDA, to 3.8x in 2012 and to 3.2x in 2013. We could lower the 	
ratings if Braskem's liquidity weakens or its financial profile doesn't 	
improve as we expect, resulting in a sustained adjusted total debt to EBITDA 	
of more than 4.0x and funds from operations to adjusted total debt 	
consistently below 20%. Because the ratings already consider improvements in 	
credit metrics, we believe an upgrade is unlikely in the intermediate term.

    By Ernest Scheyder	
    April 26 (Reuters) - Solid sales of herbicides and other agricultural
products helped Dow Chemical Co's first-quarter profit beat Wall
Street's expectations, but lower-than-expected revenue pushed shares down nearly
4 percent in morning trading.	
    Dow's chemicals and other products are used to make plastics, computers,
clothing and many other consumer goods. The company's results are often seen as
a barometer of global economic health.	
    The largest U.S. chemical maker by sales said the U.S.  economy was
improving, helped by shale-derived natural gas, and that China would continue to
be an attractive growth market.	
    But parts of Europe remain in ""recessionary conditions,"" the company said.
Volume rose in Europe only because of a propylene supply agreement Dow has with
Braskem SA for that continent after the Brazilian company bought
Dow's polypropylene business last year. 	
    ""We anticipate that global growth will gain momentum as we move through the
second quarter and into the remainder of the year,"" Chief Executive Andrew
Liveris said.	
    	
    For the quarter ended March 31, the company posted net income of $412
million, or 35 cents per share, compared with $625 million, or 54 cents per
share, in the year-ago period.	
    Earlier this month, Dow said it would close four plants and lay off 900
workers, part of a plan to slash costs by $250 million annually amid a weak
global economy. Liveris on Thursday described those moves as
""clear, surgical actions.""	
    Excluding a charge for that restructuring plan, and other one-time items,
the company earned 61 cents a share.	
    By that measure, analysts had expected earnings of 59 cents per share,
according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   	
    Revenue fell less than 1 percent to $14.72 billion. Analysts had projected
revenue of $15.01 billion.	
    Shares fell 3.9 percent to $34.65 in morning trading after closing at $36.08
on Wednesday. The stock has traded between $20.61 and $42.23 in the past 52
weeks.	
    	
    PRODUCT AREAS	
    A strong start to the North American planting season helped Dow sell more
herbicides, pesticides and other agricultural products. Sales jumped 14 percent.	
    The company is awaiting U.S. approval for its Enlist biotech corn, which is
engineered to withstand liberal dousings of a Dow-developed herbicide.
 	
    The government is taking public comments on the new product through Friday,
and if approved, Enlist would give Dow a potent weapon to fight rivals DuPont
 and Monsanto.	
    Liveris said Enlist should launch by the end of the year or early 2012.	
    Sales of Dow's performance plastics dropped 11 percent largely due to weak
margins in Europe and Asia. Dow uses crude oil-derived naphtha in those regions
to make some plastics, and high oil prices have harmed profit. 	
    In North America, by contrast, Dow uses shale-derived natural gas to make
some plastics, and the cheap price of natural gas has boosted regional margins.	
    The company is building new ethylene plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast to
process even more natural gas derived from shale drilling.	
    Sales of de-icing fluids and other performance material products from Dow
fell 2 percent, partly due to a warm North American winter.	
    	
    CASH RESERVES	
    Dow's cash fell 34 percent during the quarter to $3.61 billion as the
company culled debt by more than $1 billion during the quarter.	
    Dow said the ratio its debt to market capitalization is roughly 41 percent
now. 	
    Earlier this month Dow boosted its quarterly dividend to 32 cents from 25
cents. 	
    ""Our firm priority is to increasingly reward shareholders, pay down debt and
invest in growth priorities,"" Liveris said on a conference call with investors. 	
    	
    OLYMPICS	
    Dow is an official global sponsor of the Olympics, and this summer's games
in London is the first since the sponsorship was inked more than two years ago.	
    However, Dow's connection to a 1984 gas leak in Bhopal, India, threatens to
scuttle the goodwill. Several environmental groups have launched a media
campaign ahead of the London event to get Dow removed as an official sponsor.
    	
    The leak occurred at a pesticide factory owned by a subsidiary of Union
Carbide, which sold the facility in 1994. Dow bought Union Carbide in 2001.	
    The Indian government wants Dow to pay an additional $1.7 billion, but Dow
has refused, saying it has no responsibility for Bhopal and that Union Carbide
settled liabilities. 	
    British Prime Minister David Cameron has defended Dow's sponsorship of the
Olympics.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

2012-05-18,https://www.reuters.com,Italian university switches to English for success,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italians do it better. At least that’s what the T-shirts say. The problem is in what language? Politecnico di Milano, one of Italy’s leading universities, thinks it should be English. The 149-year-old university, located in Italy’s business capital Milan, is set to become the first Italian place of higher learning to teach all its graduate courses in English when it kicks off its academic year in 2014. The aim is to kit out its students with the right stuff to gain access to the global jobs market. It’s also meant to attract top-class international students at a time when competition among universities worldwide is hotting up. “We need to prepare all our graduates for a professional world that demands a rigorous international outlook,” Politecnico rector Giovanni Azzone told Reuters. The university - one of the world’s top 50 engineering schools according to QS World University rankings - will offer all its Master of Science and PhD courses in English and will invest 3.2 million euros to attract international faculty. Azzone said that in today’s modern world it’s crucial young people know how to work with different cultures. “Our graduates very often have to work on projects with scholars from China, India and many other countries,” he said. “Getting them used to an inter-cultural environment prepares them better for the world of work.” With Italy’s job market shrinking in a cold economic climate and emerging markets adding more jobs by the day, Italian universities are adapting to the new reality. Increasing the number of courses taught in English and internationalizing higher education to make it more competitive is a key part of Education Minister Francesco Profumo’s policy as the government looks for ways to stimulate growth. Italy’s most prestigious business school, Bocconi, was the first to offer undergraduate classes in English back in 2001. Today it teaches about 50 percent of its graduate courses in English. And the number is set to grow. “The lingua franca for business is English and you need to know it. Our students are very active on international markets and demand an international environment,” Dean of International Affairs at Bocconi University Fulvio Ortu said. Politecnico di Milano teaches science, engineering and design and counts among its alumnae Nobel prize winner Giulio Natta, who discovered polypropylene, and top international architect Renzo Piano. Globalization is increasing the demand for skilled workers around the world, especially in science, while in Italy even small and medium-sized companies are now looking to international markets. “Overseas job offers for our graduates rose 42 percent in 2011 and I don’t see the trend falling off,” Azzone said.

Azzone said that in today’s modern world it’s crucial young people know how to work with different cultures. “Our graduates very often have to work on projects with scholars from China, India and many other countries,” he said. “Getting them used to an inter-cultural environment prepares them better for the world of work.” With Italy’s job market shrinking in a cold economic climate and emerging markets adding more jobs by the day, Italian universities are adapting to the new reality. Increasing the number of courses taught in English and internationalising higher education to make it more competitive is a key part of Education Minister Francesco Profumo’s policy as the government looks for ways to stimulate growth. Italy’s most prestigious business school, Bocconi, was the first to offer undergraduate classes in English back in 2001. Today it teaches about 50 percent of its graduate courses in English. And the number is set to grow. “The lingua franca for business is English and you need to know it. Our students are very active on international markets and demand an international environment,” Dean of International Affairs at Bocconi University Fulvio Ortu said. Politecnico di Milano teaches science, engineering and design and counts among its alumnae Nobel prize winner Giulio Natta, who discovered polypropylene, and top international architect Renzo Piano. Globalisation is increasing the demand for skilled workers around the world, especially in science, while in Italy even small and medium-sized companies are now looking to international markets. “Overseas job offers for our graduates rose 42 percent in 2011 and I don’t see the trend falling off,” Azzone said.

2012-05-18,https://www.reuters.com,Analysis: China plastics demand won't revive enough to melt glut,"SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s consumption of plastic could grow by up to 7 percent this year after stalling in 2011, but the rebound will not be enough to melt a regional supply glut that will curb the output of plastic manufacturers and pressure the petrochemical market. Women work at a plastic factory, which makes plastic parts for electronic production, in Que Vo district, outside Hanoi May 20, 2011. REUTERS/Kham/FilesAsian plastic exporters, who rely heavily on demand from the world’s second-biggest economy, face having to scale back production further this year, in turn cutting demand for naphtha - the key oil product used to make plastic. Plastic demand is a key gauge of the health of Chinese manufacturing given its use in almost everything from iPads to cars and packaging, but weak traditional export markets and Bejing’s steps to cool economic growth are still hitting sales. A Reuters survey of five consultants and a leading industry body sees China’s consumption of plastic by Asia’s top importer growing around 5-7 percent, up on last year’s flat growth but well down on the double-digit growth in 2009-2010. “2012 could still be a problematic year. You are unlikely to see growth going back to levels seen in 2009,” said Malaysia-based Mazlan Razak of consultancy Nexant Asia Inc, who projects that demand in China could grow at least 5 percent. Higher oil prices with Brent crude averaging $118.21 a barrel this year, up 6.6 percent from 2011’s $110.91, are also squeezing margins, which could push plastic makers to cut runs, hitting demand for the raw material ethylene made from naphtha. “A lot of people are going from hand-to-mouth and are keeping inventories low. If (raw material) costs get too high, people would stop buying,” Razak said. Naphtha margins, the premiums from refining Brent crude, hit a 5-1/2 month low at $76.13 a metric ton (1.1023 tons) on May 16. Although less than half of the February 29 high of $182.63, margins remain well above the near minus $190 in late 2008 when the crisis hit. HOME DEMAND TO IMPROVE; LOWER IMPORTS NEEDED In Asia, South Korea has overtaken Japan as the leading manufacturer of ethylene. Key exporters of petrochemicals to China include Taiwan’s Formosa Petrochemical Corp (6505.TW), Asia’s top naphtha importer, Japan’s Mitsubishi Chemical MSCHML.UL and South Korean firms including YNCC, LG Chem and Honam Petrochemical. Japanese exports have been losing out to competitors in South Korea and Taiwan due mainly to higher production costs because of the smaller scale of production and older technology. A petrochemicals trader in Japan said a strong yen was also hurting the sector along with shaky Chinese demand. China has forecast its economy will grow 7.5 percent in 2012, the slowest in eight years, with exports crimped to traditional customers such as Europe and the United States. China’s industrial production also weakened sharply in April, while the central bank recently cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves, in a move to support the economy. “I am not expecting much growth (in Chinese plastics demand) in the first half of 2012 as China is still facing export demand loss due to weak global economies,” said J P Nah, Asia director of polyolefins at consultancy IHS Chemical. Polyolefins is a term used for polyethylene and polypropylene, two of the most widely used plastics, which are made mostly from naphtha-based ethylene in Asia. Slideshow (2 Images)More than 70 percent of the polyethylene consumed in China goes into packaging, while more than 60 percent of polypropylene is used for consumer and electronic goods, data from the China Petroleum and Chemical Industry Federation showed. With weaker exports to the United States and Europe, Nah said China could look to spur exports to emerging economies such as the Middle East and Africa, which could help plastic demand grow 6.5 to 7.0 percent this year. “Things might bump up in the second half of 2012 through 2013,” he added. China consumed 17.27 million metric tons of polyethylene in 2011, with imports contributing 43 percent, federation data showed. “But we expect China’s polyolefins’ consumption to rise slightly this year by around 5 percent, driven mainly by increasing domestic demand for consumer products,” said an official at the federation who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media. On the other hand, polypropylene imports this year are seen falling again due to higher local production, the official said. MELTING THE EXCESS PLASTIC The single-digit growth in China’s plastic consumption will not be enough to break the supply glut in Asia, where production is outpacing demand. While Asia’s demand for polyethylene could grow 6 percent this year to 39.7 million metric tons, according to data from IHS Chemical, polyethylene production is expected to grow 8 percent to nearly 42.6 million metric tons. High-density polyethylene prices were quoted at about $1,500 a metric ton on a cost-and-freight (C&F;) basis in China last month versus around $1,300 in mid-January, up by about 15 percent. In contrast, naphtha-based ethylene prices were up nearly 22 percent to around $1,400 in mid-April compared to mid-January. “There is a huge disconnection between plastic prices and raw material costs,” said a Singapore-based trader. IHS’s Nah sees operating rates at Asian plastic producers cut to 85 to 88 percent in 2012 and 2013, against about 90 percent on average last year. Run cuts are not the only difficulty Asian plastic exporters face. They need to constantly hunt for new outlets beyond the region. For now, some of these exporters are finding an alternative outlet in Brazil, which will need another 1 to 2 years before it starts up its own plastic units. “Brazil was predominantly a market for the United States. But the South Koreans have gone there. Spain has also gone there. So have Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Thailand,” said Paul Hodges, chairman of London-based consulting firm International eChem. This is because China is becoming a less attractive option for Asian plastic exporters as it increases production at home and gets more imports from the Middle East, which uses cheaper gas feedstock. North Asian polyethylene exports to China were down 18 percent in 2011, said Hodges. “It’s a gathering storm. The export market is getting more competitive,” he said. “People have inflated ideas of Chinese demand.” Additional reporting by Jasmin Choo; Editing by Ed Davies and Clarence FernandezOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

2012-05-21,https://www.reuters.com,Uzbekistan gets $2.54 bln in loans for gas project,"ALMATY, May 21 (Reuters) - Uzbekistan has signed a deal with a consortium of foreign banks to obtain loans worth a total of $2.54 billion to build a gas and chemicals complex on its Surgil field, state oil and gas company Uzbekneftegaz said. Uzbekneftegaz said in a statement the signing ceremony had taken place in the Uzbek capital Tashkent on Saturday. “The construction of the Ustyurt gas chemical complex is the first project of such scale to be implemented in the petrochemical sector on the basis of long-term project financing not only in Uzbekistan, but in the entire territory of the CIS,” the company said in a statement posted on its site, www.ung.uz. The total cost of the project is $4 billion, it said. South Korean firms KOGAS, Honam Petrochemcial  and STX Energy, together with Uzbekneftegaz, would contribute more than $1.4 billion to the project, it said. A consortium of foreign banks, including the Asian Development Bank, the Export-Import Bank of Korea, China Development Bank and others, would provide loans for a total of $2.54 billion for 16 years. The Export-Import Bank of Korea alone contributed $1 billion to the project, Uzbekneftegaz said. The Asian Development Bank has said it approved its part of project financing in January. The construction of the gas and chemical complex and development of Surgil and other local fields is to be realised by Uzbek-Korean joint venture Uz-Kor Gas Chemical, in which Uzbekneftegaz holds 50 percent. The other half is held by Honam Petrochemical and STX Energy. From 2016, the project on the Ustyurt plateau will allow annual production of 4.5 billion cubic metres of natural gas, 400,000 tonnes of high-density polyethylene, 100,000 tonnes of polypropylene and 110,000 tonnes of pyrolized gasoline, Uzbekneftegaz said. It will also create over 1,000 jobs. 	 	  (Reporting by Dmitry Solovyov; Editing by Robin Paxton and Hans-Juergen Peters)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
2012-05-29,https://www.reuters.com,TEXT-S&P raises Intertape Polymer Group Inc ratings,"Overview	
     -- Operating results and credit metrics at tape and film producer 	
Intertape Polymer Group Inc. have strengthened over the past year.	
     -- We are raising our corporate credit rating on the company to 'B' from 	
'B-' and raising our issue-level ratings by one notch.	
     -- The stable outlook reflects our expectation that the company should be 	
able to maintain an improved financial profile at levels consistent with the 	
ratings.	
	
	
Rating Action	
On May 29, 2012, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services raised its corporate 	
credit rating on Montreal, Canada-based Intertape Polymer Group Inc. 	
(Intertape) to 'B' from 'B-'. The outlook is stable. At the same time, we 	
raised our issue-level rating on the company's subordinated notes to 'CCC+' 	
from 'CCC'. Subsidiary Intertape Polymer U.S. Inc. issued the subordinated 	
notes. The recovery rating on the notes remains unchanged at '6', indicating 	
our expectation for negligible (0% to 10%) recovery in the event of a payment 	
default.	
	
Rationale	
The upgrade reflects the company's improved operating performance, mainly as a 	
result of a better pricing environment, its cost-reduction efforts, and a 	
shift in the mix to higher-margin products. EBITDA for the 12 months ended 	
March 31, 2012, was about $71 million, substantially higher than the $45 	
million the prior year. Stronger earnings, coupled with higher cash flow 	
generation and a moderate reduction in debt, have led to improved liquidity 	
and credit metrics. The key ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to total debt 	
was 22% as of March 31, 2012--a moderate increase from 13% a year earlier. We 	
adjust debt by about $30 million to include the present value of operating 	
leases and tax-adjusted postretirement benefit obligations. We believe that 	
the ratio will continue to reflect volatility in the company's operating 	
performance and, over the business cycle, we expect the ratio to average about 	
15%. Our expectations for stable-to-improving operating performance are based 	
on Standard & Poor's outlook for continued modest U.S. economic growth in 2012.	
	
The ratings on Intertape reflect our assessment of the company's business risk 	
profile as ""vulnerable"" and financial risk profile as ""aggressive."" With 	
annual sales of nearly $800 million as of March 31, 2012, Intertape 	
manufactures mainly tapes, films, and woven products for the industrial, 	
packaging, housing and construction, and the relatively stable food and 	
consumer durables end markets.	
	
The company's end markets are steadily improving, and we anticipate that this 	
will continue in 2012. Nonetheless, we expect the company's operating 	
performance will remain vulnerable to volatile input costs, including 	
polyethylene and polypropylene resin costs, and to economic slowdowns and 	
competition. Despite improved earnings over the last year, EBITDA margins 	
remain weak, at about 9% as of March 31, 2012.	
	
Intertape has midsize market shares in its niches, but it is not the largest 	
player in many of its segments. The tapes market has only a few 	
well-established players, including Intertape. Although competition can at 	
times constrain pricing, the company benefits from the absence of severe price 	
competition in most product categories. The company's competitive position in 	
its market niches and positive long-term growth prospects for industrial tape 	
demand in North America partially mitigate weaknesses in its business risk 	
profile. Tapes are the company's largest business--in 2011 it accounted for 	
66% of revenues. Products mainly consist of carton sealing tapes, industrial 	
tapes (including masking tape and duct tape), and water activated tape. The 	
films business, which accounted for nearly 20% of 2011 revenues, complements 	
the tapes business and uses the same distribution network that markets the 	
majority of Intertape's other products. The woven products business includes 	
lumber wrap and house wrap for use in the housing construction market.	
	
Liquidity	
Liquidity is ""adequate."" The company's $200 million asset-based lending (ABL) 	
revolving credit facility is a key source of liquidity. In February 2012, 	
Intertape amended and extended the maturity of its ABL facility to 2017. 	
However, the company's senior subordinated notes mature in August 2014 and, 	
unless these notes are refinanced or the maturity is extended, the ABL would 	
mature 90 days before the subordinated notes. Therefore, we expect the company 	
to take steps to repay or refinance this debt over the next 12 to 18 months.	
	
As of May 8, 2012, the company reported cash balances and availability under 	
the credit facility of $84 million. The company's applicable borrowing base--a 	
percentage of eligible trade accounts receivable, inventories, and machinery 	
and equipment--is used to determine the amount available to the company under 	
the facility. As part of the amendment to the ABL, the reappraisal of 	
machinery and equipment led to a modest increase in the company's borrowing 	
base. Although we expect the company's earnings to be relatively stable in 	
2012, unexpected shocks could pressure liquidity. The ABL facility is subject 	
to a springing fixed-charge covenant of 1x, which is applicable only if 	
availability is less than $25 million. The covenant has not been in effect in 	
recent quarters, but the company reports that its fixed-charge ratio was 	
greater than the 1x threshold at the end of first-quarter 2012. Based on our 	
scenario forecasts, we expect that availability under the ABL will remain 	
moderately above the $25 million threshold and therefore the company should 	
not be subject to the springing covenant in the next few quarters.	
	
Our assessment of liquidity is based on the following assumptions and analysis:	
     -- We expect the company's sources of liquidity to exceed its uses by 	
1.2x or more over the next 12 to 24 months.	
     -- Net sources would be positive even with a 15% drop in EBITDA.	
     -- Based on our scenario forecasts, we expect free cash flow generation 	
to be modestly positive over the next several quarters. Still, free cash flow 	
has been erratic and the company remains vulnerable to volatile input costs.	
     -- We do not expect any meaningful increase in capital spending or any 	
significant outflows on shareholder rewards, acquisitions, or growth 	
initiatives.	
	
	
Recovery analysis	
For the complete recovery analysis, see our recovery report on Intertape 	
Polymer U.S. Inc. to be published after this report on RatingsDirect. 	
	
Outlook	
The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Intertape will be able to at 	
least maintain its improved operating performance in 2012 as it benefits from 	
what we anticipate will be a modest economic recovery. We expect the company's 	
continued focus on shifting to a higher margin product mix, ongoing cost 	
reduction initiatives, and new product introductions should lead to a modest 	
increase in 2012 earnings. The outlook also reflects our view that positive 	
free cash flow generation should continue to support the company's adequate 	
liquidity. We expect the company will address the upcoming 2014 debt 	
maturities in a timely manner.	
	
We could raise the ratings modestly if Intertape is able to sustain its 	
improved credit metrics, so that FFO to total debt remains above 20%, even 	
after accounting for potential downturns. We could also consider a modest 	
upgrade if free cash flow is greater than we expect, allowing the company to 	
reduce debt. Alternatively, we could lower the ratings if the recent 	
improvement in EBITDA reverses and free cash flow turns negative, causing 	
liquidity to deteriorate. Based on our downside scenario, we could lower the 	
ratings if the company can't fully pass on escalating raw material prices to 	
customers, causing EBITDA margins to deteriorate by 200 basis points or more 	
from our expectations. If this were to happen, we would expect that total 	
adjusted debt to EBITDA would weaken to about 5x.

2012-08-02,https://www.reuters.com,FEATURE-Kuwait cabinet may be key to ending political gridlock,"KUWAIT, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Facing a bigger and bolder opposition swept into parliament by voters frustrated with Kuwait’s dysfunctional politics, the country’s rulers are under pressure to appoint a cabinet that can survive long enough to deliver much-needed reforms. Opposition candidates won a solid majority in the 50-seat assembly last week, tapping into a surge of anger over the unpopular former prime minister and corruption, which drew rare protests onto the streets last year. Kuwait’s new prime minister Sheikh Jaber al-Mubarak al-Sabah, as always handpicked by the country’s emir, will now appoint a new cabinet before parliament holds its first session, due within two weeks. The make-up of that cabinet may determine, at least in part, how successful the next government will be in unfreezing the political gridlock that has paralysed the tiny Gulf state. “You need now a magic formula to appease everybody and to make sure that this parliament will not from day one start bickering and fighting with the cabinet,” said Abdullah al-Shayji, chairman of political science at Kuwait University. The new line-up will have to make allowances for the shift in power on the ground, which could mean appointing more members of the elected assembly. Under Kuwait’s constitution, at least one elected MP must also be given a ministerial position. In the previous administration, a single parliamentarian was selected. “What is more important than the parliament is the formation of the cabinet,” said Ghanim al-Najjar, professor of political science at Kuwait University. Without an enemy, the opposition, which is united by little more than antagonism toward the government given that political parties are banned, could even be forced to join the cabinet at the table instead of challenging it. However, there are no indications that the opposition is inclined to make concessions given the mandate they have just been given. Insiders say a feud over which branch of the al-Sabah dynasty gets to rule has exacerbated the situation as warring sheikhs back different MPs to weaken rivals. Historically, the title of crown prince has passed back and forth between the Salem and Jaber branches of the family. But the current Jaber emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, ascended the throne in 2006 after the previous infirm emir from the Salem side reigned for just nine days, which means the Jaber line has effectively held on to the position since 1977. “There has to be a ceasefire among the ruling family in order for this cabinet to function properly outside the wheeling and dealing and pulling and shoving,” Shayji said. So far, the track record is not encouraging. Seven cabinets have come and gone in the past five years, usually to dodge embarrassing questioning in parliament. Parliamentarians have sought to grill ministers over everything from squandering public funds to allowing “Star Academy” - the Arab talent show equivalent of the “X-Factor” - to be broadcast on Kuwaiti TV screens. “It (the result) was expected because of the bi-polar society we’ve been living in with the previous parliament,” said Jassim al-Qamis, who managed the re-election campaign for liberal candidate Aseel al-Awadhi. Many who lost ground in the vote, such as liberal and Shi’ite Muslim candidates, were seen by voters as too lenient on the outgoing Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammed al-Sabah, whom they accused of graft. Islamist candidates made gains due to their aggressive stance against Sheikh Nasser rather than religious fervor. LOST OPPORTUNITY The deadlock has turned the U.S. ally from Gulf trailblazer to laggard, holding up reforms and pushing the level of foreign direct investment in the country to the lowest in the region. In the past decade, Kuwait attracted just $1.5 billion in foreign investment, or a mere 0.5 percent of total Gulf inflows, while impoverished Yemen attracted $3.5 billion. Kuwait’s economy grew by 5.7 percent in 2011, compared with 6.5 percent for Saudi Arabia and 18.75 percent in Qatar, according to IMF estimates. Kuwait’s investment as a percentage of GDP has consistently trailed Gulf peers since the mid-nineties. Although the government runs a budget surplus of about 24 percent - by far the highest in the Gulf, according to the International Monetary Fund - the extra money has yet to translate into better infrastructure. Farouk Soussa, Middle East chief economist at Citi, warned that Kuwait might enter “a period of more messy politics” where policy gridlock could continue to deter investment and block big economic development projects. A senior private banker told Reuters he received a call from an important client in Kuwait asking him to invest more of his funds outside the country after hearing the election result. In 2008, Kuwait cancelled a $17.4 billion proposed joint venture with Dow Chemical after parliament challenged the cabinet and threatened to subject the prime minister to questioning over the deal, which would have involved a cash payment of $7.5 billion just as the global economy was reeling from the first wave of the global financial crisis. The joint venture was aimed at taking advantage of Kuwait’s oil wealth to produce petrochemicals and plastics such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polycarbonate, used in products ranging from plastic bottles and compact disks to computers and agricultural compounds, and would have created thousands of jobs.

2012-08-02,https://www.reuters.com,Kuwait cabinet may be key to ending political gridlock,"KUWAIT (Reuters) - Facing a bigger and bolder opposition swept into parliament by voters frustrated with Kuwait’s dysfunctional politics, the country’s rulers are under pressure to appoint a cabinet that can survive long enough to deliver much-needed reforms. Opposition candidates won a solid majority in the 50-seat assembly last week, tapping into a surge of anger over the unpopular former prime minister and corruption, which drew rare protests onto the streets last year. Kuwait’s new prime minister Sheikh Jaber al-Mubarak al-Sabah, as always handpicked by the country’s emir, will now appoint a new cabinet before parliament holds its first session, due within two weeks. The make-up of that cabinet may determine, at least in part, how successful the next government will be in unfreezing the political gridlock that has paralyzed the tiny Gulf state. “You need now a magic formula to appease everybody and to make sure that this parliament will not from day one start bickering and fighting with the cabinet,” said Abdullah al-Shayji, chairman of political science at Kuwait University. The new line-up will have to make allowances for the shift in power on the ground, which could mean appointing more members of the elected assembly. Under Kuwait’s constitution, at least one elected MP must also be given a ministerial position. In the previous administration, a single parliamentarian was selected. “What is more important than the parliament is the formation of the cabinet,” said Ghanim al-Najjar, professor of political science at Kuwait University. Without an enemy, the opposition, which is united by little more than antagonism toward the government given that political parties are banned, could even be forced to join the cabinet at the table instead of challenging it. However, there are no indications that the opposition is inclined to make concessions given the mandate they have just been given. Insiders say a feud over which branch of the al-Sabah dynasty gets to rule has exacerbated the situation as warring sheikhs back different MPs to weaken rivals. Historically, the title of crown prince has passed back and forth between the Salem and Jaber branches of the family. But the current Jaber emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, ascended the throne in 2006 after the previous infirm emir from the Salem side reigned for just nine days, which means the Jaber line has effectively held on to the position since 1977. “There has to be a ceasefire among the ruling family in order for this cabinet to function properly outside the wheeling and dealing and pulling and shoving,” Shayji said. So far, the track record is not encouraging. Seven cabinets have come and gone in the past five years, usually to dodge embarrassing questioning in parliament. Parliamentarians have sought to grill ministers over everything from squandering public funds to allowing “Star Academy” - the Arab talent show equivalent of the “X-Factor” - to be broadcast on Kuwaiti TV screens. “It (the result) was expected because of the bi-polar society we’ve been living in with the previous parliament,” said Jassim al-Qamis, who managed the re-election campaign for liberal candidate Aseel al-Awadhi. Many who lost ground in the vote, such as liberal and Shi’ite Muslim candidates, were seen by voters as too lenient on the outgoing Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammed al-Sabah, whom they accused of graft. Islamist candidates made gains due to their aggressive stance against Sheikh Nasser rather than religious fervor. LOST OPPORTUNITY The deadlock has turned the U.S. ally from Gulf trailblazer to laggard, holding up reforms and pushing the level of foreign direct investment in the country to the lowest in the region. In the past decade, Kuwait attracted just $1.5 billion in foreign investment, or a mere 0.5 percent of total Gulf inflows, while impoverished Yemen attracted $3.5 billion. Kuwait’s economy grew by 5.7 percent in 2011, compared with 6.5 percent for Saudi Arabia and 18.75 percent in Qatar, according to IMF estimates. Kuwait’s investment as a percentage of GDP has consistently trailed Gulf peers since the mid-nineties. Although the government runs a budget surplus of about 24 percent - by far the highest in the Gulf, according to the International Monetary Fund - the extra money has yet to translate into better infrastructure. Farouk Soussa, Middle East chief economist at Citi, warned that Kuwait might enter “a period of more messy politics” where policy gridlock could continue to deter investment and block big economic development projects. A senior private banker told Reuters he received a call from an important client in Kuwait asking him to invest more of his funds outside the country after hearing the election result. In 2008, Kuwait cancelled a $17.4 billion proposed joint venture with Dow Chemical after parliament challenged the cabinet and threatened to subject the prime minister to questioning over the deal, which would have involved a cash payment of $7.5 billion just as the global economy was reeling from the first wave of the global financial crisis. The joint venture was aimed at taking advantage of Kuwait’s oil wealth to produce petrochemicals and plastics such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polycarbonate, used in products ranging from plastic bottles and compact disks to computers and agricultural compounds, and would have created thousands of jobs. The same year, liberal parliamentarians successfully engineered the collapse of a $15 billion refinery deal. No major deals have been proposed since. Political reforms demanded by opposition politicians and youth groups include an independent judiciary and an end to the ban on political parties, and that the prime minister be elected.

2012-08-11,https://www.reuters.com,TEXT-Fitch Rates Alpek's Proposed Notes 'BBB-(exp)',"MONTERREY, November 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to Alpek, S.A.B. de C.V. (Alpek) —Foreign Currency Long Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) ‘BBB-‘; —Local Currency Long Term IDR ‘BBB-‘; —Proposed up to USD600 million senior unsecured notes due up to 2022 ‘BBB-(exp)’. The Rating Outlook is Stable Alpek’s ratings reflect its strong business profile in the petrochemical segment in Mexico and the Americas, supported by leading positions in its different product lines, especially in the polyester chain in North America; low cost structure as a result of important investments in technology, as well as geographic location and scale; solid customer base and end markets’ resilience to economic downturns. The ratings consider the company’s solid financial profile characterized by constant positive free cash flow generation and low leverage. Fitch expects that Alpek’s ratio of net debt to EBITDA in the long term to be around 1.5x. Also incorporated in the company’s ratings are the cyclical nature of the industry, strong competitive environment and Alpek’s historic acquisitive track record. Product and Geographic Diversification Supports Business Profile Alpek’s business are divided in the polyester chain (PTA, PET and fibers), through its subsidiary Grupo Petrotemex, S.A. de C.V. (Petrotemex, rated BBB-/Stable by Fitch), which represents approximately 70-75% of Alpek’s consolidated revenues and EBITDA, and other plastics and chemicals segment, which main products are polypropylene (PP), expanded polystyrene (EPS), caprolactam (CPL) and fertilizers, among others. The company holds leading market positions in PTA and PET in North America, where prices are set using a cost plus formula, allowing Alpek’s operations to maintain stable cash flows. In addition, the company is the sole producer of PP in Mexico through its joint venture (JV) with LyondellBasell, has important participation in Mexico and North American EPS markets through its JV with BASF and is the sole producer of CPL in Mexico with most of its production dedicated to exports. Alpek’s operations have maintained high utilization rates, which in turn has translated into better fixed cost absorption and stable cash flows. The company’s customer base operates mostly in less volatile industries, such as food and beverage, packaging and consumer goods end markets. In addition, the company has long term relationships with suppliers and clients, and in the specific case of Petrotemex, long term contracts. In recent years, Alpek growth through acquisitions, especially in the PTA/PET segment, and organic expansions has positioned it as a major player in the polyester chain in North America, which strengthens its business profile and allows it to operate in a less volatile market. The exit of some participants in U.S. has resulted in market rationalization and ease competitive pressures. Volumes in the region should be driven by stable customer demand and the expectation of no additional capacity in the near term. Fitch expects the company will continue investing in efficiency projects, as well as capacity growth, with a combination of green field investments and potential acquisitions. Solid Financial Profile The ratings consider the company’s strong cash flow generation reflecting high and efficient capacity utilization rates, long term contracts and relationships with clients, cost-plus pricing formula in the PTA segment and strict cost and expenses control initiatives, among other factors. Also factored in the ratings is the company’s growth strategy which has been financed with a combination of debt, internal generated funds and equity. Alpek’s liquidity profile is solid and was strengthened with the proceeds from the recent IPO. Event risks is still present, nevertheless Fitch’s analysis incorporates the company’s strong commitment to support a robust financial profile going forward and that any likely investment will be completed with internally generated cash flows and debt. Net leverage may increase to approximately 2.0x but with a gradual reduction to 1.5x once the projects mature. Low leverage and Adequate Liquidity Alpek’s leverage is low. After debt reduction coming from the recent IPO, the company’s Total Debt to EBITDA for the last twelve months ended Sep. 30 2012 was 1.4x and Net Debt to EBITDA 0.6x. Fitch expects these credit metrics will remain relatively stable in the future. As of Sep. 30, 2012, Alpek’s cash and marketable securities was approximately USD462 million, short term debt was USD99 million and total debt USD1.06 billion. Total debt balance is expected to remain stable and debt maturities during 2013 are manageable at approximately USD100-120 million. On a pro-forma basis considering the proposed issuance of senior notes, debt maturities will be reduced to USD30-40 million in 2013. The company’s liquidity is further supported by committed credit lines of USD310 million; availability under these facilities as of Sep. 30 2012 is approximately USD276 million. Key Rating Drivers A negative rating action could arise from a combination of sharp and consistent reductions in volumes, profitability and cash flow generation resulting in lower fixed-cost absorption and weaker main credit metrics. A larger than expected debt-financed acquisition that impacts the company’s capital structure away from the target net debt to EBITDA of 1.5x on the long term should also pressure the ratings. Positive rating actions are limited at the time and could be supported by consistent positive free cash flow generation through economic cycles combined with the expectation of lower leverage levels in the mid to long term.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
2012-08-11,https://www.reuters.com,TEXT-S&P affirms Braskem SA's 'BBB-' and 'brAAA' ratings,"Overview
     -- Braskem S.A.'s expected deleveraging has been delayed due to
soft demand and competition from imports, resulting from global overcapacity. 
However, despite its recent underperformance, the firm's main credit ratios 
should gradually start to recover by year-end 2012. 
     -- The strength of Braskem's business profile, the company's commitment 
to deleveraging, and its strong liquidity continue to support its 
creditworthiness.
     -- We are affirming our 'BBB-' global scale and 'brAAA' national scale 
ratings on Braskem. 
     -- The stable outlook reflects our expectation that the company counts on 
the operating and financial flexibility to reach the financial ratios that, in 
our view, are commensurate with the current rating levels.

Rating Action
On Nov. 8, 2012, Standard & Poor's Rating Services affirmed its 'BBB-' global 
scale and 'brAAA' national scale ratings on Brazil-based petrochemical company 
Braskem S.A. The outlook remains stable.

Rationale
The rating affirmations are primarily based on our expectations that Braskem 
will maintain its competitive advantages in the Federative Republic of 
Brazil's (foreign currency rating BBB/Stable/A-2, local currency rating 
A-/Stable/A-2) petrochemical industry, its increasingly efficient operations 
with larger scale and feedstock diversification, and its strong ownership, 
which provides it with the flexibility to adjust to industry downturns. 

Despite the company's weak performance in the first half of 2012, we believe 
that it continues to have capital discipline and committed with an important 
deleverage that should allow it by year-end 2013 to show net debt financial 
metrics that are more commensurate with our current assessment of a 
""significant"" financial risk profile. 

Despite strong competition from imports, the company benefits from its 
dominant position in Brazil's petrochemicals market as the sole local producer 
of polyethylene and polypropylene, and a leading supplier of polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC). Braskem's feedstock contracts with Petrobras, its close 
commercial relationships with its fragmented customer base, and its strong 
distribution capabilities allow it to sell products at adequate margins--even 
under severe competitive pressure. We believe that Braskem's more balanced 
feedstock mix between naphtha and ethane, its high flexibility to plan 
production efficiently at several plants, its economies of scope and scale, 
and its operating synergies will help the company weather uncertainties and, 
potentially, a longer market downturn. 

The company reported a much weaker-than-expected operating performance during 
2012, as a result of an important deceleration in industrial production in 
Brazil, import competition due to global excess capacity and favorable tax 
treatment to imported products in Brazil, and lower thermoplastic resin 
prices. Furthermore, the company's capacity utilization improvements were not 
enough to counterbalance lower petrochemicals spreads effects. These factors, 
combined with the devaluation of the Brazilian real (R$) versus the U.S. 
dollar, caused the company's adjusted total debt to EBITDA to spike to 5.7x in 
the 12 months ended September 2012, which is significantly higher than the 
3.9x for the same period last year. 

We expect that Braskem's main credit metrics will start to gradually improve 
by year-end 2012, since spreads and volumes started to increase in the second 
half of 2012. In our base case scenario, we anticipate a 5% growth in volumes 
during the next 12 month--in line with stronger GDP growth in Brazil in 
2013--and new capacity coming on stream from 2013 to 2015. We also assume that 
spreads in resins and petrochemicals will improve to the levels seen in 2011. 
Besides some recovery in demand, we believe that certain recent measures that 
the Brazilian government implemented to support the domestic economy should 
have a direct impact on petrochemicals. These measures include the elimination 
of some fiscal incentives on imports, higher import tariffs, and a substantial 
decreased in interest rates.

As a result, we expect consolidated sales to increase by about 4% in 2013, and 
EBITDA margins to improve to low double digits. Under this scenario, we 
estimate that Braskem will post adjusted total debt to EBITDA closer to 5x (or 
net adjusted debt to EBITDA close to 4x) and funds from operations (FFO) to 
adjusted debt of about 15% (FFO to adjusted net debt trending to 20%) by 
year-end 2013.

Liquidity
We assess Braskem's liquidity as ""strong."" The company reported sound cash 
reserves of R$3.8 billion as of Sept. 30, 2012, compared with short-term debt 
of R$1.4 billion. In addition, about 70% of the total outstanding debt is 
scheduled to mature after 2015, and only 6% and 7% of the total will mature in 
2012 and 2013, respectively. 

Our liquidity assessment reflects several assumptions and considerations: 
     -- Liquidity sources (including cash on hand, discretionary cash flow, 
and availability under the company's credit facility) exceeding cash uses 

by 1.85x in 2012 and 3x in 2013; 
     -- Liquidity sources continuing to exceed uses, even if EBITDA were to 
decline by 30%; 
     -- The company has undrawn committed credit facilities due 2013 and 2016 
for about R$1.2 billion; 
     -- Significant flexibility to downward revise capital expenditures under 
an unexpected financial stress scenario for the company; 
     -- Braskem continuing to manage its working capital efficiently, 
resulting in low short-term financing needs; 
     -- Access to diversified funding sources, leading to an adequate debt 
profile, with average tenor of 15 years, based on Braskem's access to 
international debt markets and its solid and well-established relationships 
with banks; 
     -- Absence of restrictive covenants; and 
     -- Generally prudent financial risk management.

Outlook
The stable outlook reflects our expectation that the company counts on the 
operating and financial flexibility to reach the financial ratios that, in our 
view, are commensurate with the current rating levels. We anticipate that 
margins will recover with the start-up of capacity expansions, the gradual 
recovery of the petrochemical industry dynamics, and the Brazilian government 
measures to stimulate the industry. As a result, we also expect FFO to net 
debt to trend to 20% and net debt to EBITDA to be lower than 4x by year-end of 
2013, before strengthening further in 2014 and 2015. The rating stability also 
depends on Braskem maintaining a strong liquidity position. 

We could lower the ratings if the company's operating performance by the end 
of 2012 and beginning of 2013 does not start to recover as expected, making it 
more difficult for it to reach the expected deleverage in 2013. Because we 
anticipated an important improvement in credit metrics in our ratings 
analysis, we believe an upgrade is unlikely in the medium term.

2012-09-08,https://www.reuters.com,Sinopec pledges help to clear Hong Kong plastic spill,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese oil giant Sinopec promised on Thursday to help clean up a big spill of tiny plastic pellets in Hong Kong waters which have washed onto many beaches and begun killing fish in fish farms. Making their first media appearance 17 days after the spillage, Sinopec executives said the cargo belonged to the company and it had set aside HK$10 million (US$1.28 million) for the clean-up, and would spend more if necessary. “We want to clean up the pellets that are still at large and find the sixth container,” Lu Dapeng, a spokesman for Sinopec, told reporters. The six containers fell off a freighter on July 23 during Hong Kong’s worst typhoon in 13 years, spilling 150-tonnes of pellets into the sea. One container is missing. The Hong Kong government has assured citizens that the white, polypropylene beads are inert and non-toxic in themselves but environmentalists say they can absorb pollutants and poison the food chain. Volunteers are trying to clear up the beads, which are used in making plastic, from beaches but only a fraction of them has been collected. Lu said Sinopec would deploy industrial vacuum cleaners to hasten the clean-up. Hong Kong’s top civil servant, Chief Secretary Carrie Lam, said on Wednesday the government would bring to book those responsible. “Let me stress here that we will definitely be persistent in pursuing those liable,” Lam said after a visit to a fish farm where fish have died, apparently after consuming the pellets. Fish at a growing number of fish farms have begun dying, operators say. “The fish are not eating, and they are getting thinner and they will die slowly,” said legislator Wong Yung-kan, who represents the agriculture and fisheries industry. “We are already seeing the impact in a number of fish farms. We will see more fish deaths.” Editing by Robert BirselOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
2012-09-08,https://www.reuters.com,TEXT-Fitch rates HPCL-Mittal Energy NCD programme at 'Fitch AA-(ind)',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Aug 09 - Fitch Ratings has assigned HPCL-Mittal Energy Limited’s (HMEL) INR15bn secured non-convertible debenture (NCD) programme a National Long-Term rating of ‘Fitch AA-(ind)’. These debentures are secured in nature with a 4% coupon rate and a significant  premium on maturity. The proceeds of the issue shall be used to prepay a part of  the existing rupee term loans thus preventing interest outgo and easing  liquidity pressures during initial years of commercial operations. HMEL’s ratings reflect the credit strength of its sponsors (Hindustan Petroleum  Corporation Limited (HPCL, ‘Fitch AAA(ind)’/ Stable) and Mittal Energy  Investment Pte Ltd (MEIL)). The ratings are underpinned by HMEL’s support  agreement with the sponsors to maintain a minimum shareholding of 51% until the  term loans are fully repaid and to fund project cost overruns as of end-March  2012. HMEL is also entitled to receive various fiscal and non-fiscal benefits  from the government of Punjab by virtue of its refinery being located in the  state. The ratings also benefit from the high refinery complexity of 12.6 on  Nelson Complexity Index, which would enable HMEL to command high refining  margins. The ratings have been notched up to reflect the existence of HMEL’s firm  ‘take-or-pay’ product off-take agreement with HPCL for the evacuation of  produced liquids (about 80% of the total production) and the former’s strong  operational linkages with, and strategic importance to, the latter. Fitch notes  that HMEL’s liquid output is fulfilling the refined products requirements of  HPCL’s distribution network in the northern India, increasing the latter’s  downstream integration. Also, HMEL enjoys significant freight advantages for its  refinery compared with the refineries located in the western India, as both its  production facility and end-markets would be located in northern India. HMEL also has long-term agreements with various other industrial users and  cement manufacturers for the supply of polypropylene and pet-coke, which also  form a significant part of its solids product slate. However, volatile gross  refinery margins along with operational challenges in ramping up the production  at its recently commissioned refinery could impact its profitability and debt  servicing capability. Moreover, the projected overcapacity in polypropylene  would expose the company to over-supply risks and pricing pressures in this  product segment. WHAT COULD TRIGGER A RATING ACTION? Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - a failure to ramp-up operations as planned leading to delayed deleveraging - any weakening of HMEL’s linkages with the sponsors - a significant deterioration in HPCL’s credit profile Positive: Future developments that may lead to positive rating action include  consolidated financial leverage (net debt/EBIDTA) of below 3x over the medium  term. HMEL is a JV between HPCL and MEIL, each with a 49% stake; the rest 2% is held  by Industrial Finance Corporation of India (1.2%) and State Bank of India  (0.8%). The JV was formed to set up a 9 million metric tonnes per annum  greenfield petroleum refinery in Punjab, which was successfully commissioned in  September 2011. HMEL’s wholly owned subsidiary, HPCL-Mittal Pipelines Limited  (‘Fitch AA-(ind)’/Stable), has set up a dedicated crude oil receipt and storage  facility in Gujarat and a 1,017 km cross-country pipeline for the transportation  of crude oil to HMEL’s refinery. HMEL’s outstanding ratings (including the above) are as follows: - National Long-Term Rating: ‘Fitch AA-(ind)’/Stable - INR80.98bn term loans: National Long-Term Fitch AA-(ind)’ - INR30bn fund-based working capital limits: National Long-Term ‘Fitch AA-(ind)’  and National Short-Term ‘Fitch A1+(ind)’ - INR20bn non-fund-based working capital limits: National Long-Term ‘Fitch  AA-(ind)’ and National Short-Term ‘Fitch A1+(ind)’ - INR15bn commercial paper programme (within fund-based working capital limits):  National Short-Term ‘Fitch A1+(ind)’ - INR5bn NCD programme: National Long-Term ‘Fitch AA-(ind)’ - INR15bn NCD programme: National Long-Term ‘Fitch AA-(ind)’Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
2012-10-02,https://www.reuters.com,LyondellBasell results miss Street; shares slump,"(Reuters) - Chemical maker LyondellBasell Industries NV’s (LYB.N) quarterly operating profit fell far short of Wall Street’s expectations as refining margins dropped and customers conserved cash. Many European customers chose to draw down stockpiles rather than make new purchases amid the sovereign debt crisis. Many of the same issues affected rival Dow Chemical DOW.N during the fourth quarter. “We expect overall first-quarter economic activity to remain slow in Europe and Asia for certain of our businesses,” LyondellBasell Chief Executive Jim Gallogly said in a statement. Operating profit dropped in all four of the company’s operating segments, and was most pronounced in its refining and oxyfuels unit, which makes gasoline. The benchmark crude oil margin the company used slipped 41 percent. The company’s European chemical plants, also known as crackers, use pricey crude oil-derived naphtha to produce chemicals, a process that is much more expensive than in the United States where cheap natural gas can be used to make the same products. In Europe the company sold 5 percent less polyethylene and 10 percent polypropylene, both essential chemicals for plastics production. The price of ethylene did rise 15 percent in North and South America, though sales of polyethylene in the region were flat and polypropylene sales edged up only slightly. LyondellBasell reported a net loss of $218 million, or 38 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, compared with net profit of $766 million, or $1.34 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items, such as early debt repayment and the mothballing of a French refinery, LyondellBasell earned 41 cents per share. By that measure, analysts on average expected 76 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 8 percent to $11.44 billion. Analysts expected $12.04 billion. During the quarter LyondellBasell, which is technically headquartered in the Netherlands but run out of Houston, doubled its dividend and said it would pay a separate special dividend. The company, which emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2010, also said it would buy back nearly $2.8 billion of debt, substantially improving its balance sheet. LyondellBasell recorded a $431 million charge in the fourth quarter for the move. Last fall LyondelBasell shut its Berre, France, refinery, which employs 370 workers. The decision sparked a strike at the plant. The company ultimately decided to put the refinery in cocoon mode, meaning it will be stopped, cleaned, and given another twos years for a potential acquirer to buy it. Shares of LyondellBasell were down 36 cents at $44.22 on the New York Stock Exchange. Elsewhere on Friday, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), which owns a stake in LyondellBasell, reported a drop in fourth-quarter earnings due to changes in the accounting value of some assets.

LyondellBasell reported a net loss of $218 million, or 38 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, compared with net profit of $766 million, or $1.34  per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items, such as early debt repayment and the mothballing of a French refinery, LyondellBasell earned 41 cents per share. By that measure, analysts on average expected 76 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 8 percent to $11.44 billion. Analysts expected $12.04 billion. During the quarter LyondellBasell, which is technically headquartered in the Netherlands but run out of Houston, doubled its dividend and said it would pay a separate special dividend. The company, which emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2010, also said it would buy back nearly $2.8 billion of debt, substantially improving its balance sheet. LyondellBasell recorded a $431 million charge in the fourth quarter for the move. Last fall LyondelBasell shut its Berre, France, refinery, which employs 370 workers. The decision sparked a strike at the plant. The company ultimately decided to put the refinery in cocoon mode, meaning it will be stopped, cleaned, and given another twos years for a potential acquirer to buy it. Shares of LyondellBasell were down 36 cents at $44.22 on the New York Stock Exchange. Elsewhere on Friday, Apollo Global Management LLC, which owns a stake in LyondellBasell, reported a drop in fourth-quarter earnings due to changes in the accounting value of some assets.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
2012-10-05,https://www.reuters.com,UPDATE 1-Brazil's Braskem eyes shale gas feedstock in U.S.,"* CEO sees decision this year on new plant or joint venture * Cost of crude oil-based feedstock hurting profitability * Profit fell 50 percent in Q1; shares hit four-month low By Carolina Marcondes and Brad Haynes SAO PAULO, May 10 (Reuters) - Brazilian petrochemicals company Braskem is looking to switch its U.S. polypropylene plants onto feedstock from shale gas as the cost of crude oil derivatives hurts profits. Chief Executive Carlos Fadigas said on Thursday the company is nearing a decision on whether to build its own plant processing propane from natural gas or form a joint venture with a guarantee to buy the project’s output. “The decision should be made this year,” Fadigas told reporters at a press conference to discuss first-quarter results, declining to estimate the possible investment. Braskem, the largest petrochemicals company in Latin America, posted a 50 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday, due to weak global demand for its plastic resin products and high prices for its crude-based raw materials. A rocky economic outlook in Europe and weak recovery in the United States has weighed on plastics prices, while unrest in the Middle East bolstered crude prices, squeezing profits for petrochemical processors like Braskem. The company’s net income fell to 152 million reais ($77 million) in the first quarter, according to a securities filing. Braskem shares dropped 4.7 percent in Sao Paulo trade to a four-month low on the results. First-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operating profit known as EBITDA, fell 14 percent from a year earlier to 787 million reais. EBITDA as a share of net revenue, a measure of profitability known as the EBITDA margin, slipped 2.9 percentage points to 9.6 percent. Braskem bought Dow Chemical’s polypropylene business last year for $340 million, expanding its U.S. presence and expanding possibilities for feedstocks other than the costly crude-based naphtha.

2012-10-08,https://www.reuters.com,TEXT-Fitch afrms OAO Nizhnekamskneftekhim at 'B+';otlk stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Aug 10 - Fitch Ratings has affirmed Tatarstan-based chemical producer OAO Nizhnekamskneftekhim’s (NKNK) Long-term foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘B+’, Short-term foreign currency IDR at ‘B’ and National Long-term Rating at ‘A-(rus)’. Fitch has also affirmed the senior unsecured rating at ‘B+’/RR4. The Outlook on the Long-term ratings is Stable. The ratings reflect NKNK’s improved operating performance, product mix and financial standing post completion of its large capex programme. Although NKNK’s underlying credit profile implies an IDR in the ‘BB’ category, the ratings are constrained by the lack of transparency on the ultimate beneficiaries of its majority shareholder, private investment company TAIF (NR), and by systemic characteristics linked with the Russian business and jurisdictional environment. In 2011 NKNK performed well and in line with the market, with 31% sales growth driven by double-digit price rises across the product portfolio and a 7.6% increase in volumes. The EBITDAR margin improved to 19.9% from 16.9%, primarily reflecting the strong pricing momentum. NKNK’s strategic shift to higher-value added petrochemical products is on track with rubbers and plastics contributing nearly 70% to 2011 sales. Fitch forecasts mid-single-digit revenue growth for 2012-2013 with moderate price drops offset by higher sales volumes. These factor in NKNK’s new ABS plastics production due to be launched in late 2012. The medium-term demand outlook for rubbers continues to be supported by favourable mobility trends in emerging markets and regulatory changes in Europe. The agency also expects positive growth momentum in the Russian plastics market as consumption remains low compared with developed economies. Under the base rating case, the EBITDAR margin remains in the high teens but contracts slightly from 2011 level due to cost inflation. Fitch’s forecasts also assume new expansionary capex to the tune of USD3bn between 2013-2017. A new olefins complex is under consideration and NKNK signed a contract in June 2012 for the design and engineering for an ethylene plant with a capacity of one million tons per annum and downstream polypropylene and polyethylene units. Under the base case, the resumption of capex translates into a gradual increase in funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage over the rating horizon, although at levels comfortable for the current rating level. The ratings reflect NKNK’s position among the world’s top-10 synthetic rubber producers by capacity and its leading positions in the Russian polymers market with the largest domestic polypropylene and polystyrene production capacity. The company has limited diversification across the rubber spectrum but benefits from top-five market positions in selected products included the higher-value halobutyl rubbers. Customer relationships continue to strengthen, as reflected in the growing share of multi-year contracts with leading global tyre manufacturers, which increased to 68% in 2011 from 15% in 2006. NKNK’s ratings also incorporate the risks related to its single-site location and its limited vertical integration (upstream) although, in mitigation, these factors translate to lower intra-group logistics costs than peers. The group’s cost advantage is also supported by the proximity of key raw materials suppliers. WHAT COULD TRIGGER A RATING ACTION? Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include- Improved transparency on the ownership structure and on the shareholders’ strategy towards the company- Full clarity on future investment plans- Maintenance of margins in the high teen and FFO net adjusted leverage sustained below 1.5x through the cycle. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include- Market deterioration or realization of supply risk leading to EBITDAR margin sustained below double-digit level- Investments and/or shareholder-friendly activities leading to FFO net adjusted leverage sustainably above 2.5x.

2012-10-12,https://www.reuters.com,TEXT-S&P summary: Braskem S.A.,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Dec 10 - =============================================================================== Summary analysis — Braskem S.A. ————————————————— 10-Dec-2012 =============================================================================== CREDIT RATING: BBB-/Stable/—                Country:        Brazil Primary SIC:    Chemicals & allied products, nec Mult.

Despite the company’s weak performance in the first half of 2012, we believe  that it continues to have capital discipline and it is committed to an  important deleveraging strategy that should allow it to show net debt  financial metrics that are more commensurate with our assessment of a  “significant” financial risk profile by year-end 2013. Despite strong competition from imports, the company benefits from its  dominant position in Brazil’s petrochemicals market as the sole local producer  of polyethylene and polypropylene, and a leading supplier of polyvinyl  chloride (PVC). Braskem’s feedstock contracts with Petrobras, its close  commercial relationships with its fragmented customer base, and its strong  distribution capabilities allow it to sell products at adequate margins—even  under severe competitive pressure. We believe that Braskem’s more balanced  feedstock mix between naphtha and ethane, its high flexibility to plan  production efficiently at several plants, its economies of scope and scale,  and its operating synergies will help it weather uncertainties and,  potentially, a longer market downturn. The company reported a much weaker-than-expected operating performance during  2012, as a result of an important deceleration in industrial production in  Brazil, import competition due to global excess capacity and favorable tax  treatment to imported products in Brazil, and lower thermoplastic resin  prices. Furthermore, the company’s capacity utilization improvements were not  enough to counterbalance lower petrochemicals spreads effects. These factors,  combined with the devaluation of the Brazilian real (R$) versus the U.S.  dollar, caused the company’s adjusted total debt to EBITDA to spike to 5.7x in  the 12 months ended September 2012, which is significantly higher than the  3.9x for the same period last year. We expect that Braskem’s main credit metrics will start to gradually improve  by year-end 2012, since its spreads and volumes started to increase in the  second half of 2012. In our base case scenario, we anticipate a 5% growth in  volumes during the next 12 month—in line with stronger GDP growth in Brazil  in 2013—and new capacity coming on stream from 2013 to 2015. We also assume  that spreads in resins and petrochemicals will improve to the levels seen in  2011. Besides some recovery in demand, we believe that certain recent measures  that the Brazilian government implemented to support the domestic economy  should have a direct impact on petrochemicals. These measures include the  elimination of some fiscal incentives on imports, higher import tariffs, and a  substantial decreased in interest rates. As a result, we expect consolidated sales to increase by about 4% in 2013, and  EBITDA margins to improve to low double digits. Under this scenario, we  estimate that Braskem will post adjusted total debt to EBITDA closer to 5x (or  net adjusted debt to EBITDA close to 4x) and funds from operations (FFO) to  adjusted debt of about 15% (FFO to adjusted net debt trending to 20%) by  year-end 2013. Liquidity We assess Braskem’s liquidity as “strong.” The company reported sound cash  reserves of R$3.8 billion as of Sept. 30, 2012, compared with short-term debt  of R$1.4 billion. In addition, about 70% of the total outstanding debt is  scheduled to mature after 2015, and only 6% and 7% of the total will mature in  2012 and 2013, respectively. Our liquidity assessment reflects several assumptions and considerations: — Liquidity sources (including cash on hand, discretionary cash flow,  and availability under the company’s credit facility) exceeding cash uses  (including working capital needs, capital expenditures, and short-term debt)  by 1.85x in 2012 and 3x in 2013; — Liquidity sources continuing to exceed uses, even if EBITDA were to  decline by 30%; — The company has undrawn committed credit facilities due 2013 and 2016  for about R$1.2 billion; — Significant flexibility to downward revise capital expenditures under  an unexpected financial stress scenario for the company; — Braskem continuing to manage its working capital efficiently,  resulting in low short-term financing needs; — Access to diversified funding sources, leading to an adequate debt  profile, with average tenor of 15 years, based on Braskem’s access to  international debt markets and its solid and well-established relationships  with banks; — Absence of restrictive covenants; and — Generally prudent financial risk management. Outlook The stable outlook reflects our expectation that the company has the operating  and financial flexibility it needs to reach the financial ratios that, in our  view, are commensurate with the rating levels. We anticipate that the  company’s margins will recover with the start-up of the capacity expansions,  the gradual recovery of the petrochemical industry dynamics, and the Brazilian  government measures to stimulate the industry. As a result, we also expect FFO  to net debt to increase to 20% and net debt to EBITDA of less than 4x by  year-end of 2013, before strengthening further in 2014 and 2015. The rating  stability also depends on Braskem maintaining a strong liquidity position. We could lower the ratings if Braskem’s operating performance does not start  to recover as expected by year-end 2012 and the beginning of 2013, making it  more difficult for the company to reach the expected deleveraging levels in  2013. We believe that an upgrade is unlikely in the medium term, since we  anticipated an important improvement in the credit metrics in our ratings  analysis.

2012-11-26,https://www.reuters.com,TEXT-S&P summary: Intertape Polymer U.S. Inc.,"The company’s end markets are steadily improving, and we anticipate that this will continue into next year, based on Standard & Poor’s outlook for modest U.S. economic growth in 2013. Given the company’s focus on shifting to a higher margin product mix, ongoing cost reduction initiatives, and new product introductions, earnings and EBITDA margins have meaningfully improved over the past year; the last-12-month EBITDA margins were 10.6% as of Sept. 30, 2012, up from 7.5% for the same period ended September 2011. Nonetheless, we expect the company’s operating performance will remain vulnerable to volatile input costs, including polyethylene and polypropylene resin costs, and to economic slowdowns and competitive pressures. Intertape has midsize market shares in its niches, but it is not the largest player in many of its segments. The tapes market has only a few well-established players, including Intertape. Although competition can at times constrain pricing, the company benefits from the absence of severe price competition in most product categories. The company’s competitive position in its market niches and positive long-term growth prospects for industrial tape demand in North America partially mitigate weaknesses in its business risk profile. Tapes are the company’s largest business—in 2011 it accounted for 66% of revenues. Products mainly consist of carton sealing tapes, industrial tapes (including masking tape and duct tape), and water activated tape. The films business, which accounted for nearly 20% of 2011 revenues, complements the tapes business and uses the same distribution network that markets the majority of Intertape’s other products. The woven products business includes lumber wrap and house wrap for use in the housing construction market. Liquidity Liquidity is “adequate.” The company’s $200 million asset-based lending (ABL) revolving credit facility is a key source of liquidity. In February 2012, Intertape amended and extended the maturity of its ABL facility to 2017. In October 2012, Intertape issued a notice of redemption for $55 million of its outstanding senior subordinated notes due August 2014. We expect that this will be funded through a combination of free cash flow, revolver drawings, and proceeds from a new $17 million real estate secured term loan. Following this redemption, there will be about $39 million in subordinated notes outstanding, which we expect the company will repay or refinance over the next few quarters. As of Nov. 6, 2012, the company reported cash balances and availability under the credit facility of about $108 million. The company’s applicable borrowing base—a percentage of eligible trade accounts receivable, inventories, and machinery and equipment—is used to determine the amount available to the company under the facility. As part of the amendment to the ABL, the reappraisal of machinery and equipment led to a modest increase in the company’s borrowing base. Although we expect the company’s earnings to be relatively stable over the next few quarters, unexpected shocks could pressure liquidity. The ABL facility is subject to a springing fixed-charge covenant of 1x, which is applicable only if availability is less than $25 million. The covenant has not been in effect in recent quarters, but the company reports that its fixed-charge ratio was greater than the 1x threshold at the end of September 2012. Based on our scenario forecasts, we expect that availability under the ABL will remain moderately above the $25 million threshold and therefore the company should not be subject to the springing covenant in the next few quarters. Our assessment of liquidity reflects the following assumptions and analysis: — We expect the company’s sources of liquidity to exceed its uses by 1.2x or more over the next 12 to 24 months. — Net sources would be positive even with a 15% drop in EBITDA. — Based on our scenario forecasts, we expect free cash flow generation to be modestly positive over the next several quarters. Still, free cash flow has been erratic and the company remains vulnerable to volatile input costs. — We do not expect any meaningful increase in capital spending or any significant outflows on shareholder rewards, acquisitions, or growth initiatives. Recovery analysis Our issue-level rating on the company’s $125 million senior subordinated notes is ‘CCC+’ (two notches below the ‘B’ corporate credit rating), and the recovery rating is ‘6’, indicating our expectation of negligible (0% to 10%) recovery in the event of a payment default. For the complete recovery analysis, see our recovery report on Intertape Polymer U.S. Inc., published on May 30, 2012, on RatingsDirect. Outlook The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Intertape will be able to at least maintain its improved operating performance over the next year based on Standard & Poor’s outlook for continued modest U.S. economic growth in 2013. We expect the company’s continued focus on shifting to a higher margin product mix, ongoing cost reduction initiatives, and new product introductions should allow it to maintain earnings and EBITDA margins at close to current levels. The outlook also reflects our view that positive free cash flow generation should continue to support the company’s adequate liquidity. We could raise the ratings by one notch if Intertape is able to sustain its improved credit metrics, so that FFO-to-total debt remains above 20%, even after accounting for potential downturns. We could also consider a modest upgrade if free cash flow is greater than we expect, allowing the company to continue to reduce debt. Although less likely at this time given the strength exhibited by the company’s credit metrics, we could lower the ratings if the recent improvement in EBITDA reverses and free cash flow turns negative, causing liquidity to deteriorate. Based on our downside scenario, we could lower the ratings if the company can’t fully pass on escalating raw material prices to customers, causing EBITDA margins to deteriorate by 400 basis points or more from current levels. If this were to happen, we would expect that total adjusted debt to EBITDA would weaken to about 5x.

2013-01-10,https://www.reuters.com,NASA spacecraft finds plastic ingredient on Saturn's moon Titan,"(Reuters) - NASA’s Cassini spacecraft has found propylene, a chemical used to make household plastic containers, on Saturn’s moon Titan, the space agency said. “This is the first definitive detection of the plastic ingredient on any moon or planet, other than Earth,” NASA said. A small amount of propylene was identified in Titan’s lower atmosphere by Cassini’s composite infrared spectrometer, which measures heat radiation, the agency reported in Monday’s edition of the Astrophysical Journal Letters. By isolating the same signal at various altitudes within the lower atmosphere, researchers identified the chemical’s unique thermal fingerprint with a high degree of confidence, NASA said. “This chemical is all around us in everyday life, strung together in long chains to form a plastic called polypropylene,” said Conor Nixon, a scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the paper. “That plastic container at the grocery store with the recycling code 5 on the bottom - that’s polypropylene.” The chemical is also used to make car bumpers and other consumer products. The discovery could help scientists understand the “chemical zoo” that makes up Titan’s hazy brownish atmosphere, said Scott Edgington, Cassini’s deputy project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.

The Outlook on the Long-term IDR  is Stable. The agency has simultaneously assigned SIBUR Securities Limited’s  proposed issue of guaranteed notes (the Notes) an expected foreign currency  senior unsecured rating of ‘BB+(EXP)’. The Notes’ final rating is contingent on the receipt of final documentation  conforming to information already received and further details regarding the  amount and tenor of the Notes. KEY DRIVERS: - SIBUR Borrower/Guarantor of the Notes SIBUR Securities Limited (the Issuer), the issuer of the bonds, is an  Ireland-based private limited liability company established for this sole  purpose. The notes will benefit from an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee  from OAO SIBUR Holding (the Guarantor). The guarantee will be a senior unsecured  obligation of OAO SIBUR Holding and will rank equally in right of payment with  all its existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. - SIBUR’s Senior Unsecured Notes Proceeds will be used for short-term debt refinancing and general corporate  purposes. Covenants apply to the issuer, the Guarantor and certain subsidiaries  and include a negative pledge (with permitted liens) and limitation on  incurrence of indebtedness with a total proforma debt-to-consolidated EBITDA  ceiling of 3.5:1. Events of default include cross default or cross acceleration  to the debt of the Issuer, the Guarantor or any material subsidiary with a  USD50m threshold. - 2012 in Line With Base Case SIBUR’s results for 9M12 are roughly in line with Fitch’s base rating case with  top line growth of 9.6%, reflecting single digit volumes growth, softer demand  growth across product portfolio and the sale of the non-core businesses in late  2011. Profitability was aided by the latter and margin erosion was limited with  EBITDA margin at 31.8% (Fitch calculation), from 35.8% in 9M11. Under the base  case, high capex and dividend levels translate into negative free cash flow  (FCF). The completion of the Tobolsk Polymer project is expected in 2013. The  500,000 tonnes of polypropylene capacity will add value to the group’s existing  propane production. - Adequate Liquidity Liquidity was adequate at end-Q312 with cash balances of RUR9.2bn and undrawn  committed general corporate purpose facilities of RUR24.2bn against maturing  short-term debt of RUB37bn. At end-Q312 gross debt was broadly flat at RUR81bn  (FYE11: RUR83bn). Fitch expects net funds from operations (FFO) leverage to peak  in 2012 at 1.5x with a gradual decrease from 2013 onwards. - Peak Capex Fitch’s base rating case assumes peak capex spending in 2012 with funds  earmarked for the completion of the Tobolsk complex, the transhipment facility  at Ust-Luga, feedstock infrastructure projects and the group’s contribution  towards various joint ventures. 9M12 capex was RUB48bn, up from RUB33bn a year  ago. Other cash requirements in 2012 include dividend distributions of RUR22bn  for FYE11 and RUR7bn for H112, in line with the group’s policy (25% of net  income). FCF is expected to be negative in 2012 due to the high investment  levels. The ratings assume that OAO SIBUR Holding will continue to access  long-term funding to refinance upcoming maturities and finance its expansion  plans. - Non-Core Assets Sold Cash flow generation benefited from the disposal of the non-core fertiliser and  tyre businesses in December 2011 for RUB47bn in aggregate. These accounted for  28% and 13% of revenues and EBITDA in 2011 (14% margin), respectively, and their  sale should translate into higher margins for SIBUR’s continuing operations. - Competitive Cost Advantage SIBUR’s ratings are supported by its leading position in the Russian  petrochemicals sector, diversified portfolio and access to associated petroleum  gas (APG) which ensures low costs versus most international peers and underpins  its strong operational cash flow generation over the cycle. - Industry and Country Risks SIBUR is exposed to the inherent risks of the petrochemical industry - price  volatility and demand cyclicality. The ratings are also constrained by the legal  and regulatory risks associated with Russia, where its key assets are located. RATING SENSITIVITY GUIDANCE: Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating actions  include: - Further operational improvements and capacity expansion resulting in enhanced  scale and product diversification and/or portfolio mix - FFO net adjusted leverage at, or below 1.5x through the cycle - Sustained positive FCF generation - Established corporate governance track record from the new shareholders Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: - Material deterioration in the company’s cost position or access to low-cost  associated petroleum gas - Sustained negative FCF generation - Aggressive financial strategy resulting in an increased financial burden and  FFO adjusted net leverage sustained above 2.0xOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

2013-02-02,https://www.reuters.com,Strike at Sabic Dutch chemical plant hits output,"KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - A strike by workers at the SABIC Europe Chemicals Geleen plant in the Netherlands has cut production, the company’s Saudi Arabian owner said on Saturday. Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE said in a bourse statement that talks with a union over working conditions had not yet been successful and that it did not know what impact the strike would have on profits or production. “The decrease in production begins 31/1/2013 due to the proactive measure taken by the union workforce as a consequence of no finalized agreement regarding work conditions,” it said in the statement. In Geleen, SABIC has two naphtha crackers and several polymerization plants to produce polyethylene and polypropylene. Galeen produces 1.25 million tonnes per year of ethylene, 725,000 tonnes per year of propylene, 940,000 tonnes per year of polyethylene, and 620,000 tonnes per year of polypropylene. “It is not possible to determine the financial effect or the effect on production capacity, at this time, because the affected plants are not yet known,” SABIC added in the statement. A SABIC spokesman in Europe said the disagreement was over payments to staff who might become redundant. De Unie, one of the unions involved in the strike action, said SABIC wanted to cut back sharply on the support offered to laid-off workers to help them find new jobs.

2013-02-12,https://www.reuters.com,Dow Chemical to exit century-old chlorine business,"(Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co DOW.N said it would sell a bulk of its chlorine operations - its oldest business - as part of its plan to sell or spin off commodity chemicals assets worth up to $4 billion. Andrew Liveris, Chairman and CEO of the Dow Chemical Company, participates in a group discussion on ""Business by Design: Business with Integrity"" during the second day of the Clinton Global Initiative 2012 (CGI) in New York on September 24, 2012. REUTERS/Lucas JacksonDow Chemical, like other U.S. chemical makers such as Dupont DD.N, is moving away from providing a wide range of products to a swathe of industries to focus on electronics, packaging and agriculture. “Exiting our longest, oldest business tells you that we are prioritizing our capital on higher margin, more consistent earnings growth businesses,” Dow Chemical Chief Executive Andrew Liveris told Reuters. Other assets identified for sale by the world’s No.1 chlorine producer on Monday included its epoxy business and some brine and energy assets, representing a total of $5 billion in revenue. The bulk of what the company plans to sell is housed in its performance materials business, which is particularly exposed to swings in commodity prices. Dow Chemical said in October it expected to raise between $3 billion and $4 billion from asset sales in the next 18 to 24 months. It had said the company would sell parts of its chlorine and derivatives assets such as chlorinated organics - used in electronics and refrigerants - and vinyls, used to make a raw material for water pipes. The largest U.S. chemical maker by sales has shed non-core businesses representing about $10 billion in revenue since 2009, including its Styron plastics business that it sold to private-equity firm Bain Capital Partners for $1.63 billion in 2010. It sold its polypropylene licensing and catalyst business in October to smaller rival W.R. Grace & Co (GRA.N) for $500 million. The company said in August that it was looking at options for its European construction materials businesses. Dow Chemical, which gets a quarter of its revenue from the performance plastics business, has also reduced its exposure to lower margin plastics and now focuses on plastics used in sophisticated packaging, diapers and wound-care products. The company’s shares rose nearly 3 percent to $40.04 by midday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has risen 30 percent over the past year. DE-CHLORINATION Dow said on Monday it would shut about 800,000 tons of chlorine and caustic equivalent capacity in Freeport, Texas. The capacity being shut down will be replaced with supply from new facilities that will come online in early 2014 with the start-up of the company’s chloralkali joint venture with Japan’s Mitsui & Co (8031.T). The news lifted shares of chloralkali suppliers such as Axiall Corp AXLL.N, Olin Corp (OLN.N) and Westlake Chemical Corp (WLK.N). “The announcement lifts a major overhang on the chloralkali industry and respective players, as the potential of overcapacity has kept many investors concerned over the future supply/demand balance,” Wells Fargo analyst Frank Mitsch said. Dow Chemical, however, is looking to sell its interest in the joint venture as part of this reorganization and will eventually buy a small amount of chlorine from the new owners of the JV after it divests its interest. “We are not disposing of all the chlorine because we are retaining chlorine for our value add downstreams. We are only exiting that which is servicing the commodity part of chlorine” said Liveris.

    By Asher Levine
    SAO PAULO, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks rose on
Tuesday as an improvement in German investor sentiment boosted
appetite for the most widely traded commodities producers.
    Mexico's IPC index edged higher for the second day in
three, while Chile's bourse remained flat.
    Shares rose after data on Tuesday showed German investor and
analyst sentiment rose to a nearly three-year high in February,
suggesting a recovery in Europe's largest economy may be gaining
steam. 
    The data boosted appetite for shares of commodities firms,
whose performance is often linked to global economic growth
sentiment.
    Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index snapped a
four-day losing streak, gaining 0.5 percent to 57,899.28.
    Preferred shares of iron-ore mining giant Vale SA 
gained 1 percent, contributing most to the index's rise, while
state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA,
known as Petrobras, added 0.6 percent.
    ""The data today suggests things abroad are recovering,"" said
Adriano Moreno, an analyst with Futura Corretora in Salvador,
Brazil. ""The Brazilian market has fallen far behind many
others...so we see the Bovespa with room to catch up a bit.""
    Shares of telecommunications firm Grupo Oi SA 
rose 5 percent after the company said on Tuesday that it expects
sales and operating income to pick up speed in 2013, despite
having posted fourth-quarter net profit that fell below
analysts' estimates. 
    Shares of Braskem SA, the largest petrochemical
company in Latin America, soared 6.55 percent - their most in
over five months - after Credit Suisse analysts changed their
rating on the shares to ""outperform"" from ""neutral,"" citing
potential tax benefits for naphtha purchases and possible import
tax hikes on polypropylene.
    Preferred shares of steelmaker Usinas Sider?rgicas de Minas
Gerais SA were little changed after the company
posted a bigger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss late on
Monday. 
    ""There were also some good things in Usiminas' results,""
added Moreno, citing strong iron ore sales and an improved
outlook. ""The stock had also fallen a lot recently and the
results were already priced in.""
    Mexico's IPC index added 0.56 percent to 44,389.32 as
shares of telecommunications firm America Movil rose
0.7 percent.

The largest U.S. chemical maker said it has divested non-core businesses representing about $8 billion in revenue since 2009. “We are reviewing our entire portfolio and seeking even further opportunities to optimize value: selectively pruning assets that are no longer a strategic or financial fit ... “ Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said in a statement on Thursday. Dow’s polypropylene licensing & catalysts business provides technology to make polypropylene. Its plastics additives business supplies additives used in construction materials, packaging containers, consumer appliances, electronics and automotive parts. The company has been struggling with weak demand for ethylene, propylene and other chemicals used to make plastics. It said in October that it will shutter 20 plants and cut 5 percent of workforce, following a round of cost cuts. It divested its global polypropylene business in 2011 to Braskem SA, Brazil’s biggest petrochemical company, for $323 million. The polypropylene licensing & catalysts business and related catalyst facilities were not part of the sale. Sales at Dow’s performance materials business, which includes plastic additives among other products, fell 7 percent to $13.61 billion in 2012.

A worker checks the certification labels on wine bottles on a conveyor belt at the Rostberg bottling plant near Cape Town in this November 29, 2012 file photo. REUTERS/Mike Hutchings/FilesBut if a trend toward bulk shipping continues, the music of the Rostberg bottling plant may be about to stop. Set in lush vineyards in Stellenbosch, one of South Africa’s most famous wine communities, Rostberg has been operating below capacity for the past two years due to a shift to shipping wine in 24,000-litre polypropylene “flexitanks”. The trend has spread through other “New World” wine-producing countries like Chile, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand, which all have distant markets and, in the latter two cases at least, relatively strong currencies that are forcing them to cut costs to stay competitive. Bottlers in South Africa are frantic about the likely loss of jobs. But another concern for some industry experts and government officials is the potential impact on South Africa’s brand: when wine is bottled outside the country, winemakers lose control of a key part of the production process. These are big concerns for South Africa, where the wine industry plays an outsized role in reshaping the country’s image after years under apartheid, which ended in 1994. “Wine has a tremendously important role to play in the development of Brand South Africa,” said Anthony Budd, managing director of Cape Town-based wine exporter Diverse Flavours. “Wine is that much more romantic and seen as premium and coming from a beautiful location.” The number of people working directly or indirectly in South Africa’s wine industry has risen to more than 275,000 people from just under 160,000 in 2000, and now represents 1.5 percent of the workforce in an economy dominated by natural resources. The industry has made huge inroads as a producer of high-quality wines since overseas markets opened up after apartheid, said Michael Fridjhon, visiting professor of wine business at the University of Cape Town’s business school. “In 1994, we were the darling of the world,” he said. “Everybody wanted to do something for the ‘Rainbow Nation’... Since then, we’ve been on a steep learning curve.” Exports have soared more than 700 percent to a record 409 million liters in 2012. Now the country’s biggest agricultural export earner, wine sets South Africa apart from other sub-Saharan African countries known for exporting predominantly raw materials. Seventy percent of the 26 billion rand ($2.8 billion) it contributes to the national economy is focused on the Western Cape province, which boasts ideal conditions for wine-making with its Mediterranean climate, mountain slopes and valleys, and sea breezes from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The Western Cape is also where the majority of bottlers are located. JOBS Nearly half of all wine from South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Chile and Argentina is shipped in bulk, up from around a fifth a decade before, according to a report published last year by Dutch bank Rabobank entitled ‘The Incredible Bulk. The Rise in the Global Bulk Wine Trade’. As recently as 2009, just over 61 percent of South African wine exports were bottled domestically but that share dropped to 40 percent last year, according to industry export and promotion group Wines of South Africa (WOSA). Bulk exports overtook bottled shipments in Australia for the first time in January 2011, industry group Wine Australia said. Major Australian producers like Jacob’s Creek are now bottling in Britain, the world’s largest wine import market. Bevan Newton Johnson, managing director at First Cape, the largest South African wine brand in Britain, said the company mothballed its own bottling facility nearly two years ago, laying off around 40 people. “Our products were not profitable in the overseas markets,” he said. The South African government is concerned about the effect on employment. Close to 1,000 jobs were lost due to the shift to bulk as of the end of 2011, according to the Department of Trade and Industry, and industry representatives said the trend suggests that more cuts are coming. In South Africa, where the unemployment rate has remained at 25 percent for years, that has a multiplier effect - the country has one of the highest “dependency ratios” in the world at an average of three non-working people supported by every worker, according to a January 2013 report by the South African Institute of Race Relations. Two bottling plants in Stellenbosch have closed since 2010. Consol Glass, South Africa’s biggest glass manufacturer, is preparing to cut production this year because of the sharp fall in demand for wine bottles. Its wine sector business, which accounts for a quarter of revenues, has declined by more than 20 percent over the last three years. Rostberg, located on the Rust en Vrede wine estate which produced the wine served at former President Nelson Mandela’s Nobel Peace Prize dinner, had to shut down one bottling line in 2010, and was forced to lay off 35 staff, half its workforce. “The only way we can create more jobs is if we could bottle our wine locally,” said Leo Burger, Rostberg’s managing director. The government has threatened to retaliate against the UK, the world’s biggest market for imported wine, by importing bulk whisky from Britain for bottling in South Africa. “The big winners in this trend are the bottlers who operate in the UK and the EU,” said Stephen Hanival, director of agro-processing at the Department of Trade and Industry. “Jobs and capacity have been lost in developing countries like South Africa.” Bottlers and the wine industry are trying to counter the growth in bulk exports by diversifying to China, Japan and other parts of Africa, where the demand for premium wine is growing. South Africa exported 5.5 million liters of packaged wine to China in the year to February 2013, a 24 percent increase from the previous year. SUPERMARKET LABELS A big factor in the shift to bulk is the growing influence of supermarkets. Retailers in Europe have been able to squeeze pricing from their suppliers to attract customers recovering from the recession, said Stephen Rannekleiv, Rabobank’s executive director of food and agribusiness research. Some have created competing private label wine brands using foreign-sourced bulk wine. Fraser Thompson, head of the IPL Wine subsidiary at Asda, the British arm of U.S. retailer Walmart, said countries like South Africa have had no choice but to shift to bulk to stay competitive. Asda has increased its sourcing from South Africa in recent years, partly thanks to UK bottling, he said. “South Africa is competing on a global stage with every other wine-producing nation,” he said. “Without shipping in bulk there’s a danger that South Africa would lose considerable export trade to the UK and across the world.” Around a third of the wine imported by Asda is now bottled in the UK, where it set up its own bottling plant in December 2011 in Snetterton, Norfolk. South African industry and government officials have expressed concern about what happens to the wine after it leaves the polypropylene tanks. Hanival was particularly worried about the potential for South African wine to be blended with a lower quality wine and marketed as South African, which could have consequences for its hard-won reputation for high quality at the right price. “In the past the UK consumer saw South African wine as moderate-to-low quality but at a very low price point,” he said. “These days South African wine is seen as of moderate-to-good quality, still at a good price point ... I think we have managed to lose that label of cheap and cheerful, relatively low-quality wine.” A spokeswoman at Asda strongly denied any trans-national blending took place at Asda. Tesco and Sainsbury’s, the two other big supermarket chains in Britain, did not respond to requests for comment on this story. Bottling in South Africa includes a trackable certification seal, with various guarantees for the consumer, Rostberg said. “Our wine certification system ensures the origin, cultivar (grape variety) and vintage only up to the harbor when it is exported in bulk, but no further,” he said. Slideshow (11 Images)The reputational risk around the possibility of blending is uncomfortably high, some in the industry say. “Odds are that it will adversely affect the reputation (of South African wine),” said Fridjhon. “Effectively what you’re doing is turning wine into a commodity.” ($1 = 9.1960 South African rand) Editing by Pascal Fletcher and Sonya HepinstallOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

2013-04-09,https://www.reuters.com,UPDATE 1-Nigeria's Dangote signs $3.3 bln loan from banks for refinery,"* Loan led by Standard Chartered and Guaranty Trust Bank * Refinery will double Nigeria’s capacity By Joe Brock ABUJA, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s Dangote Industries clinched a $3.3 billion syndicated loan from banks on Wednesday for a 400,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery and petrochemical plant, saying the project would cut African reliance on international markets. Standard Chartered and Nigeria’s Guaranty Trust Bank led the loan deal, which also involved two South African and eight Nigerian banks. Dangote Group, the umbrella company of Africa’s richest man Aliko Dangote, has said it is seeking a further $2.25 billion from development funds for the $9 billion project, into which it would put $3.5 billion of its own equity, and which will also produce fertilisers. “As a result, several African nations will be less reliant on importing fuel and fertiliser from foreign markets, reducing the negative impact of negotiating terms within increasingly turbulent international markets,” Aliko Dangote said at the signing ceremony in Nigeria’s capital Abuja. Nigeria imports 80 percent of fuel needs and the lack of refining capacity is a major brake on Africa’s second biggest economy. The company expects the refinery to be completed around 2016. A statement issued at the event said the plant will produce 2.8 million tonnes of urea for fertilising crops and polypropylene, used to make plastics and synthetic fabrics. The Dangote Group has interests ranging from cement  to basic food processing   to oil and gas. The statement said stronger profit margins at Dangote Cement , which makes up nearly a third of the stock exchange, meant it could afford to foray into such projects. “The project will significantly boost Nigeria’s economic productivity and create valuable jobs,” the head of Standard Chartered’s Nigeria branch Bola Adesola said. Nigeria now has the capacity to produce some 445,000 barrels per day among four refineries, but they operate well below that level owing to decades of mismanagement and corruption. A boost to its refining capacity would be a blow to European refiners and oil traders, which make huge profits bringing gasoline into the country. Other banks involved in the loan were South Africa’s Standard Bank and FirstRand, and Nigerian lenders Access Bank, Zenith Bank, Ecobank Nigeria Limited, Fidelity Bank, First Bank, Diamond Bank, UBA and First City Monument Bank. “I expect over the next year or two we will see other investors coming into the private refining sector,” Oil Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke said at an economic summit in Abuja, where the signing took place.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
2013-05-31,https://www.reuters.com,RPT-Fitch affirms Merinos Hali Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. at 'B+'; stable outlook,"(Repeat for additional susbcribers) May 31 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Turkey-based Merinos Hali Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S.’s (Merinos) Long-term foreign and local currency Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at ‘B+’. Fitch has also  affirmed Merinos’ National Long-term rating at ‘A-(tur)’. All three ratings have  Stable Outlooks. The ratings continue to reflect Merinos status, as one of the  largest producers of machine-made carpets in the world. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Trading Performance:  At the end of 2012 Merinos’s revenues were TRY539m,  slightly higher than our rating case for the year. The growth rate was muted  compared to previous years as growth in the Turkish economy was slower than  expected (GDP growth 3%). Despite slower than expected growth in the domestic  economy and increasing energy prices in Turkey (which affected profitability of  almost all Turkish corporates) Merinos managed to increase its EBITDA margin up  to 18.3% from 16% in 2011. Lack of Visibility on Merinos Recourse Debt and Contingent Liabilities: Fitch is  concerned about the guarantees given by Merinos Hali A.S. to its marketing  sister companies and the lack of visibility on Merinos recourse debt and  contingent liabilities. The management states that they have been reducing the  corporate guarantees as the debt is rolled over, and in six months’ time,  Merinos is aiming to have 0% corporate guarantees to the sister companies.  Although the leverage metrics still support Merinos’ current rating level,  however, due to the mentioned above, the ratings are capped at the current  rating level. Export Revenues:  Merinos has been increasing the share of exports in the past  three-four years, creating a more balanced revenue distribution. In 2012,  exports continued increasing to 49% of revenues from 35% in 2009. Almost 70% of  hard currency exports come from countries like Germany, Russia and USA where the  economic environment is less gloomy (as has been the case for previous years),  easing our concerns about the quality of hard currency revenues. We believe that Merinos will continue increasing its exports - as per the  management strategy - in the future as its European competitors face financial  difficulties and Middle Eastern peers suffer from political instability. Unless  the world economy faces a deepened economic depression, Merinos is likely to at  least maintain current export levels and continue easing our concerns about F/X  mismatch. Domestic Market Leader:  Merinos is one of the top three machine-made carpet  manufacturers in the world in terms of installed capacity, commanding around 40%  of the fragmented Turkish market. The company also produces acrylic and  polypropylene yarn. Merinos is 60%-owned by Erdemoglu Holding, with the rest  held by Erdemoglu family members. Erdemoglu Holding and the family also have  interests in another carpet manufacturer focusing mainly on wall-to-wall  carpets, Dinarsu, and a household furniture company within the Erdemoglu group  of companies. Historically Tight Liquidity: The carpet business has low cash positions and  high funding needs due to the unfavourable working-capital cycle, and  historically Merinos has operated with low cash levels. Fitch believes that  Merinos has continued access to financing to support its working capital and  capex needs. FX Exposure:  Merinos’ export revenue covers its interim FX-denominated interest  payments, easing Fitch’s concerns about its already reduced FX exposure. Fitch  believes Merinos’s ability to raise additional debt will remain a function of  its strong operating profitability and cash generation ability RATING SENSITIVITIES Deterioration in credit metrics:   A negative rating action could result from  further deterioration in credit metrics. The lack of visibility on Recourse debt and contingent liabilities is a major  limiting rating factor, which could result on negative rating actions if this  concern escalates. A positive rating action could result from a sustained improvement in company  reporting and leverage. This is not anticipated at this time. LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE The carpet business has low cash positions and high funding needs due to the  unfavourable working-capital cycle, and historically Merinos has operated with  low cash levels. Fitch believes that Merinos has continued access to financing  to support its working capital and capex needs. Fitch is concerned about the guarantees given by Merinos Hali A.S. to its  marketing sister companies and the lack of visibility on Merinos recourse debt  and contingent liabilities. The management states that they have been reducing  the corporate guarantees as the debt is rolled over, and in six months’ time,  Merinos is aiming to have 0% corporate guarantees to the sister companies.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
2013-06-08,https://www.reuters.com,CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-Dow Chemical may sell businesses exposed to commodity swings (July 25),"(Corrects paragraphs 1 and 8 to show company is considering selling its epoxy business, not its paint business) * CEO says wants to shed low-cost commodity businesses * 2nd-qtr revenue at agricultural sciences unit grows 10 percent * Adjusted profit $0.64/share vs est.$0.63/share * Shares rise 1.5 percent By Swetha Gopinath and Garima Goel July 25 (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co will consider selling its epoxy, construction and chlorine businesses as it joins industry rivals in shedding units vulnerable to commodity price swings, its chief executive said. Dow, the largest U.S. chemical maker by sales, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday due to strong margins in its plastics business and higher sales of pesticides to farmers. Its shares rose 1.5 percent in morning trading. Like competitor DuPont, the company is pushing hard into the agricultural sector, where sales have been booming on year-round demand for seeds and pesticides for the crops needed to feed an expanding global population. DuPont said on Tuesday that it planned to exit its titanium paint pigments business to focus on its agricultural unit, where higher sales helped to boost quarterly profit. Dow Chemical has already divested non-core businesses worth about $8 billion in revenue since 2009, and plans this year to close the previously announced sale of its polypropylene licensing and catalyst business and its plastics additives unit. “One-third of our business is in low-cost commodity, cyclical-type business, where my competition is state-owned enterprises,” Dow Chemical Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. “My competition is racing to commoditize my products. That means I have to keep working them out of the portfolio and keep moving to areas of high-margin, high-technology.” On a post-earnings conference call with analysts, Liveris identified the company’s epoxy business as a candidate for divestment, as well its European building and construction and commodity chlorine derivatives units. Epoxy resins are used to make laminates, moulds, insulators, transformers and generators. The building and construction business mainly makes insulation products. “Here, we see the need for more dramatic interventions,” he said. “These businesses are in the fix/take-action mode, which includes exploring all possibilities - including joint venturing or divesting them.” Dow Chemical spokeswoman Rebecca Bentley said the three businesses combined contributed $6 billion in annual revenue. Some analysts, however, urged caution. “Dow has to be careful with how much of the commodity business it offloads, given that is what is generating their margin upside,” said Stephen Hoedt, a senior equity research analyst with Key Private Bank. FARMS GROWING FAST Of Dow Chemical’s six operating units, growth was fastest in the agricultural business that makes seeds, oils and chemicals to protect crops. Sales jumped 10 percent in the second quarter. A steady climb in U.S. farm income has increased demand for biotech seeds and pesticides. Dow Chemical’s agriculture sciences business, which contributed 13 percent of revenue in the quarter, also gained from strong demand in Latin America. The company’s performance plastics unit, which makes products for toy manufacturers, builders and carmakers, remained its largest business, accounting for nearly a quarter of total sales. Margins grew for a sixth straight quarter. Dow Chemical said it was well-positioned to deliver higher earnings in the second half of the year. The company expects its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to grow by $500 million this year, Chief Financial Officer William Weideman said on the call. Dow Chemical reported EBITDA of $5.6 billion, or $7.5 billion on an adjusted basis, in 2012. Weideman said the performance plastics business was expected to grow through 2013. Margins for U.S. chemical companies have improved vastly due to cheap, shale-derived natural gas, used to produce ethylene, a building block for plastics. Dow Chemical’s net income rose 72 percent to $2.34 billion, or $1.87 per share, in the second quarter, helped by the $2.2 billion received in damages from Kuwait’s state chemicals company for pulling out of the K-Dow petrochemical venture in 2008. Excluding the arbitration award and other one-time items, the company earned 64 cents per share. Dow Chemical’s shares were trading around $35 just after midday on the New York Stock Exchange.

2013-06-14,https://www.reuters.com,Analysis: U.S. plastics from gas threaten European petchem industry,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The oil-dependent European petrochemicals industry could be in for a body blow as U.S. rivals seek to get a wider range of raw materials out of cheap shale gas to make more plastics, coatings and adhesives. A factory of German chemical company BASF is pictured in Ludwigshafen February 24, 2012. REUTERS/Alex DomanskiU.S. players including Dow Chemical DOW.N and Enterprise Products Partners (EPD.N) are building facilities to convert gas into propylene, a key building block for advanced materials that has so far required the oil distillate naphtha as feedstock. This could further squeeze margins and endanger jobs at European plants that convert naphtha into precursor chemicals ethylene and propylene, the backbone of the more than 130 billion euro ($167 billion) petrochemical industry in Europe. The European facilities, run by global players including BASF (BASFn.DE), Sabic 2010.SE, Ineos INEOSG.UL and LyondellBasell (LYB.N), are particularly vulnerable to any price decline in propylene, which goes into acrylic glass, insulation foam and construction glues, as extra U.S. output has already slashed the price of ethylene. Forty-eight of these sites, called steam crackers, are spread across Europe, mainly in Benelux, Germany and France. The companies that run them can shift investment elsewhere, but jobs will be at risk in Europe; the industry employs 115,000 directly and up to 460,000 indirectly, in a region that hit a record 11 percent unemployment in April. According to a Bernstein Research note last month, BASF is eyeing a $600 million investment in a new U.S. gas-to-propylene plant. The company declined to comment. Shale gas - natural gas from hydraulic fracturing, or fracking - has allowed the U.S. chemical industry to use cheap energy and boost output of ethylene, a basic hydrocarbon precursor for solvents, packaging plastics and detergents that can be extracted from gas. The benefits were evident in LyondellBasell’s Olefins and Polyolefins business, which boasted an operating profit margin of 20 percent in the Americas last year, compared with 0.9 percent in Europe and the rest of the world. The Atlantic divide could widen further as they ramp up propylene output, and while health and environmental concerns stifle shale gas exploration in Europe. Companies like Dow, Enterprise Products and Taiwan’s Formosa Plastics (1301.TW) aim to produce extra propylene volumes on the Texas Gulf Coast from 2015. European crackers’ average revenue per tonne after deduction of feedstock and energy costs has been $659 this year, versus $798 in the United States, according to market researcher ICIS. “ON-PURPOSE” PROPYLENE Propylene had become scarce and expensive as the prevailing method of converting gas into basic petrochemicals - natural gas steam cracking - yields abundant ethylene but little propylene. Steam crackers that feed on the oil distillate naphtha, the cracker type that prevails in Europe, are the main source of propylene, but only as a by-product. More than half their output is ethylene, now made far more cheaply in the United States, where natural gas prices have plunged 50 percent in five years. Only a price hike in by-products such as propylene and butadiene, used in synthetic rubber and nylon, has provided some relief for the European basic petrochemicals industry. “Operators of European naphtha crackers have a problem. In a nutshell, it’s about propylene, butadiene, and benzene prices. You need to be compensated somewhere for the cheaper ethylene,” said London-based Berenberg Bank analyst Jaideep Pandya. But now propylene is set to become cheaper. U.S. oil and petrochemical groups are erecting so-called “on-purpose” propylene production sites based on propane from natural gas to end reliance on the insufficient stream of by-product propylene from ethylene production. New on-purpose plants could add roughly 4 million tonnes to annual propylene output by 2018, 5 percent of current global production, says market researcher IHS Chemical. BASF said many of the industry’s European sites would remain competitive due to an intricate network of pipelines and proximity to customers, while imports from the Middle East and the U.S. were burdened with tariffs and transport costs. Ineos plans to ship cheap U.S. ethane gas to its gas cracker in Norway from 2015, “to secure the long term future of its sites in Europe”. But its naphtha crackers can’t use ethane. The region’s downstream specialty chemical makers, which use propylene as raw material, may also be in for a shake-up. The nascent U.S. gas-to-propylene industry is widely expected to further process its source of cheap feedstock into intermediates such as propylene oxide, acrylic acid and polypropylene in about three to five years. This could become a headache for the European advanced plastics industry. Propylene oxides go into insulation foam chemicals made by BASF and Bayer (BAYGn.DE), while acrylic acid is the basis for adhesives, acrylic glass and glossy coatings offered by BASF, Evonik (EVKn.DE) and Arkema (AKE.PA). The quickest gains for U.S. propylene makers would be to expand into polypropylene, a standard plastic used in packaging, sticky tape and ropes, which plays only a minor role in European production, but they wouldn’t stop there. Chuck Carr, a Houston-based petrochemicals adviser at IHS said the first 3 million tonnes of new annual U.S. propylene would address the domestic shortage but everything beyond could go oversees in the form of specialty chemicals and plastics. “We’re going to add enough to export,” he said.

2013-07-25,https://www.reuters.com,Dow Chemical may sell businesses exposed to commodity swings,"(Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co DOW.N will consider selling its paint, construction and chlorine businesses as it joins industry rivals in shedding units vulnerable to commodity price swings, its chief executive said. Cars drive past a plant of U.S. chemical producer Dow near the eastern German village of Lippendorf south of Leipzig March 25, 2004. Reuters/Arnd WiegmannDow, the largest U.S. chemical maker by sales, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday due to strong margins in its plastics business and higher sales of pesticides to farmers. Its shares rose 1.5 percent in morning trading. Like competitor DuPont DD.N, the company is pushing hard into the agricultural sector, where sales have been booming on year-round demand for seeds and pesticides for the crops needed to feed an expanding global population. DuPont said on Tuesday that it planned to exit its titanium paint pigments business to focus on its agricultural unit, where higher sales helped to boost quarterly profit. Dow Chemical has already divested non-core businesses worth about $8 billion in revenue since 2009, and plans this year to close the previously announced sale of its polypropylene licensing and catalyst business and its plastics additives unit. “One-third of our business is in low-cost commodity, cyclical-type business, where my competition is state-owned enterprises,” Dow Chemical Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said in an interview with CNBC on Thursday. “My competition is racing to commoditize my products. That means I have to keep working them out of the portfolio and keep moving to areas of high-margin, high-technology.” On a post-earnings conference call with analysts, Liveris identified the company’s Epoxy, or industrial paint, business as a candidate for divestment, as well its European building and construction and commodity chlorine derivatives units. “Here, we see the need for more dramatic interventions,” he said. “These businesses are in the fix/take-action mode, which includes exploring all possibilities - including joint venturing or divesting them.” Dow Chemical spokeswoman Rebecca Bentley said the three businesses combined contributed $6 billion in annual revenue. Some analysts, however, urged caution. “Dow has to be careful with how much of the commodity business it offloads, given that is what is generating their margin upside,” said Stephen Hoedt, a senior equity research analyst with Key Private Bank. FARMS GROWING FAST Of Dow Chemical’s six operating units, growth was fastest in the agricultural business that makes seeds, oils and chemicals to protect crops. Sales jumped 10 percent in the second quarter. A steady climb in U.S. farm income has increased demand for biotech seeds and pesticides. Dow Chemical’s agriculture sciences business, which contributed 13 percent of revenue in the quarter, also gained from strong demand in Latin America. The company’s performance plastics unit, which makes products for toy manufacturers, builders and carmakers, remained its largest business, accounting for nearly a quarter of total sales. Margins grew for a sixth straight quarter. Dow Chemical said it was well-positioned to deliver higher earnings in the second half of the year. The company expects its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to grow by $500 million this year, Chief Financial Officer William Weideman said on the call.

2013-08-29,https://www.reuters.com,Apollo leads private equity fundraising charge,"NEW YORK, August 28 (Reuters-BUYOUTS) - Apollo Global Management LLC has drawn $8.4 billion in commitments for its latest flagship fund, Apollo Investment Fund VIII LP, suggesting the era of private equity mega-funds is far from over. The New York-based turnaround specialist, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Leon Black, capitalized both on its brand-name recognition and the strong performance of the predecessor fund to raise the money. It also benefited from growing interest from international investors. “Apollo is well-positioned to capitalize on several powerful secular trends that are favoring our industry, including increasing allocations to alternatives institutional investors to meet their return objectives in a low interest-rate environment,” Marc Spilker, president of Apollo Global Management, told shareholders on the firm’s August 8 quarterly-earnings conference call. Investors in Apollo Investment Fund VIII include Oregon Investment Council, which committed $300 million, and New York City Public Pension Funds, which pledged $500 million. Private equity firms typically take about 12 to 18 months or more to raise a new fund through a series of private meetings with prospective investors. The target of Fund VIII is $12 billion. The latest fund marks the successor to Apollo Investment Fund VII LP, a $14.9 billion, vintage-2008 pool that benefited from the economic recovery following the Great Recession. The firm reported it had generated a net internal rate of return (IRR) of 28 percent on Fund VII as of June 30; all told, it has returned $14.9 billion on $14.7 billion invested, with the remaining portfolio valued at $12 billion. Those returns make Fund VII one of the best-performing U.S. buyout funds of its era. “They put a lot of it to work at distressed prices, and they reaped the benefits,” said Robert Lee, an analyst who covers Apollo Global’s common stock for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, an investment bank. Lee, who calls Apollo Global a “distress-oriented firm,” rates the firm’s public shares as an “outperform”. The firm went public in March 2011 and the company trades at $26 a share, 35 percent above its IPO price. Among the standout performers in Fund VII was LyondellBasell Industries, the world’s third-largest independent chemicals company (and the biggest maker of polypropylene); the company went bankrupt at the height of the economic crisis. As the firm restructured, Apollo Global’s Fund VII invested between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in the firm. Later, when LyondellBasell went public again, in 2010, the firm’s stake in the company grew to be worth between $6.5 billion and $7 billion, for a 3x to 4x gain, according to news reports. Other companies in Fund VII have included CKE Restaurants, the owners of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s; Hostess Brands, the maker of Twinkies and Ding-Dongs; Norwegian Cruise Lines, and the textbook division of McGraw-Hill. On a Buyouts Magazine list of U.S. buyouts firms that have raised the most money this year, Apollo Global ranks first for Fund VIII, ahead of the $6.9 billion raised for Carlyle Partners VI LP and the $6.3 billion raised for Silver Lake Partners IV LP. Warburg Pincus LLL has raised about $5.7 billion for Warburg Pincus Private Equity XI LP this year to bring that fund to a total dollar value of $11.2 billion. Lone Star Funds holds the fifth-highest fundraising tally for 2013 with about $5.1 billion raised for Lone Star Fund VIII.

Andrew Liveris, Chairman and CEO of the Dow Chemical Company, participates in a group discussion on ""Business by Design: Business with Integrity"" during the second day of the Clinton Global Initiative 2012 (CGI) in New York on September 24, 2012. REUTERS/Lucas JacksonThe bulk of what Dow Chemical plans to sell is housed in its performance materials business, which was mainly responsible for the company’s weaker-than-expected quarterly results. Dow Chemical shares were down 1.5 percent at $40.45 in early afternoon trading on Thursday. The performance materials unit includes the epoxy and commodity chlorine derivatives businesses that Dow Chemical wants to sell. “In performance materials, we are still facing significant headwinds and so that’s why you see us increasing that divestiture target to $3 billion-$4 billion,” spokeswoman Rebecca Bentley said. Dow Chemical was earlier targeting proceeds of $1.5 billion from sales of non-core assets. “It’s possible that they will even increase that target again,” UBS Investment Research analyst John Roberts said. The company will shed its epoxy business through a joint venture or a sale, with a transaction expected in the near term, Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said on a conference call. Demand for epoxy resins, used in windmill blades and a host of other products, has tumbled due to excess capacity in China and the loss of subsidies for wind energy in Europe. Liveris said the company would sell parts of its chlorine and derivatives assets such as chlorinated organics — used in electronics and refrigerants among other things — and vinyls, used to make a raw material for water pipes. The company said in August that it was also looking at options for its European construction materials businesses. “We are moving away from being all things to all markets and going deeper and narrower into profit pools ...,” Liveris said, adding the company’s focus would now be electronics, packaging and agriculture. The company sold its polypropylene licensing and catalyst business to smaller rival W.R. Grace & Co (GRA.N) for $500 million this month. The largest U.S. chemical maker by sales has divested non-core businesses representing about $8 billion in revenue since 2009. PLASTIC GAINS OVERSHADOWED The performance plastics business, Dow Chemical’s largest unit, has enjoyed margin expansion, driven by abundance of cheap shale-derived natural gas, used to produce ethylene, a building block for plastics. EBITDA at the segment shot up 32 percent. The company expects strong margins to continue in the business, Chief Financial Officer William Weideman said on the post-earnings call, adding that its agricultural sciences business would continue to grow as well. EBITDA at the performance materials business fell 36 percent in the third quarter. Dow Chemical’s net income rose 20 percent to $594 million, or 49 cents per share, helped mainly by the plastics, packaging, coatings and electronics businesses. The adjusted profit was 50 cents per share, missing the average analyst estimate of 54 cents per share. Revenue rose 1 percent to $13.73 billion. Analysts on average had expected $13.99 billion.

2013-12-27,https://www.reuters.com,Sinopec Engineering to build $3.1 bln coal-to-chemical plant,"BEIJING, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Sinopec Engineering Group  said it has entered into a deal to build a $3.1 billion plant in northern China to turn coal into petrochemicals, as China seeks to reduce its reliance on petrochemical imports. Sinopec Engineering will be responsible for engineering, procurement and construction of the 18.67 billion-yuan project in Inner Mongolia, which it said would be the largest of its kind in the world. The plant will produce 3.6 million tonnes a year of olefins - mostly ethyelene which is a building block for petrochemicals that are widely used in construction, textiles and automobiles. China, the world’s biggest net importer of oil, is a leading buyer of petrochemicals, and imports about 45 percent of its ethylene. Sinopec Engineering, a newly listed unit of state-run Sinopec Group, said it would deploy a self-developed technology to make olefins from methanol, which can be extracted from coal. The coal-based process is cost competitive versus China’s conventional way of making petrochemicals from more costly naphtha, a refinery product processed from crude oil. “Sinopec has long realized that it needs to diversify feedstocks for making ethylene,” said Yan Kefeng, an analyst with consultancy IHS CERA. The plant, at Uxin county of Inner Mongolia’s Ordos city,  is owned by Zhong Tian He Chuang Co. Ltd, a joint venture which has Sinopec Corp and China Coal Energy Company among its main investors. “It is a significant milestone for SEG to establish an integrated new coal chemical industrial chain,” the company said in a statement released late on Tuesday. Key facilities of the investment include a 3.6 million tpy synthetic methanol unit, two 1.8 million-tpy methanol to olefin units and two polypropylene units. Sinopec Engineering will hand over the project by Oct 30, 2015.   ($1=6.07 yuan) Reporting by Chen Aizhu; Editing by Richard PullinOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

2014-03-26,https://www.reuters.com,Oman's ORPIC awards two contracts for plastics complex,"MUSCAT, March 26 (Reuters) - State-owned Oman Oil Refineries and Petroleum Industries Co (ORPIC) said it had awarded two contracts for construction of a $3.6 billion plastics production complex, the Liwa Plastics Project. Engineers India Ltd of New Delhi will operate the project management company, while the contract for front-end engineering and design was won by Netherlands-based Chicago Bridge & Iron Co, ORPIC said in a statement seen on Wednesday without giving the value of the deals. The plant will be built in Oman’s northern industrial city of Sohar, next to ORPIC’s oil refinery and petrochemical plants. Pre-qualifying of companies to bid for the engineering, procurement and construction contract will be finished by the end of this year, ORPIC said. The Liwa Plastics Project is due to be completed in 2018, doubling ORPIC’s profitability by allowing it to extract more value from Omani crude oil and natural gas, the company said. The project will boost ORPIC’s annual production of polypropylene and polyethylene to 1.4 million tonnes, increasing Oman’s exports, while additional production of 1 million tonnes of plastics will help to develop downstream industries within the country, ORPIC added. Oman is pouring billions of dollars into efforts to industrialise its economy and create jobs. A crackdown on corruption in the award of state contracts during recent months has resulted in nearly 30 people being sentenced to prison terms ranging from one to 23 years, raising concern among some executives that business activity could slow. However, ORPIC’s award of the Liwa contracts suggests major projects are progressing.   (Reporting by Fatma Alarami; Writing by Andrew Torchia)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
2014-05-30,https://www.reuters.com,"Turkmenistan gets $2.5 bln in Japan, Korea loans for gas complex","ASHGABAT, May 30 (Reuters) - Turkmenistan, holder of the world’s fourth-largest natural gas reserves, said on Friday it had secured a total of $2.5 billion in loans from Japan’s and South Korea’s export credit banks for construction of a gas chemical complex. Japan’s Toyo Engineering Corp said this month that its consortium with three South Korean firms had been awarded a $3 billion contract for the complex in western Turkmenistan by state concern Turkmengas. “The State Bank of Foreign Economic Affairs of Turkmenistan has struck a credit agreement for $700 million with Japan Bank for International Cooperation and another one worth $1.8 billion with Korea Eximbank for 10 years to finance construction of the plant in the Balkan region of the country,” said a government official, who declined to be identified. Turkmengas will finance the rest of the contract. The economy of Turkmenistan, a Central Asian nation of 5.5 million, has grown at an annual rate exceeding 10 percent in recent years, owing mainly to rising natural gas exports to China via a pipeline launched at the end of 2009. But the country also aspires to diversify the economy, investing billions of dollars in construction of plants to yield value-added oil and gas products. Toyo’s partners in the consortium are Hyundai Engineering Co Ltd, Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co  and LG International Corp. The complex, to be built in the Turkmenbashi district near the Caspian Sea, will produce ethylene, high-density polyethylene, and polypropylene from natural gas produced on the Caspian Sea shelf, Toyo said after winning the contract. Facilities, to be completed in 2018, include a gas separation unit with capacity of 5 billion cubic metres per year, an ethylene production unit with capacity of 400,000 tonnes per year (tpy) and a polypropylene production unit with 80,000 tpy capacity.

2014-09-25,https://www.reuters.com,Dow Chemical launches sale of chlorine and epoxy units -sources,"NEW YORK, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co has kicked off a process to sell its epoxy and chlorine businesses, hoping to find a single buyer for them in what is set to be a multibillion-dollar deal, according to people familiar with the matter. The Midland, Michigan-based company has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Barclays Plc to manage the process, the people said this week, adding that calls to potential buyers began this week. Combined, the epoxy and chlorine businesses have annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of close to $500 million, the people said. The value of assets is not yet clear. It will depend on if and how they will be carved out of their contractual arrangements and the tax implications of their separation, the people cautioned. Initial estimates place their value between $3.5 billion and $4 billion, the people added. Logical buyers might include companies in the sector such as Axiall Corp and Westlake Chemical Corp, as well as private equity firms experienced in chemicals such as Apollo Global Management LLC, the people said. Representatives for Axiall and Westlake did not respond to requests for comment, while Apollo declined to comment. A Dow representative confirmed that the company was moving forward with the sale of its U.S. Gulf Coast chlor-alkali and chlor-vinyl, global chlorinated organics, global epoxy, and brine and energy operations and supporting assets in Freeport, Texas, and Plaquemine, Louisiana. “The carve-out and separation of these businesses is progressing and engaging with interested parties is part of that process,” the representative said. Goldman Sachs and Barclays declined to comment. Dow, which makes everything from insecticides to plastics, had previously said these and other units were earmarked for sale as part of an effort to divest several billion dollars worth of non-core assets by 2015. Despite these commitments to sell assets, activist investor Daniel Loeb’s hedge fund Third Point in January urged the separation of Dow’s commoditized raw materials businesses from its specialty chemicals operations. Dow has rejected the demands, arguing that keeping the businesses together helps curb costs. Dow has already put additional assets on the block and raised the target of the proceeds it hopes to generate from the divestitures to $6 billion. Dow has hired investment bankers including Morgan Stanley  to sell its Angus Chemical Co subsidiary, as well as AgroFresh Inc, which could collectively fetch up to $2 billion, Reuters reported in August. Dow has also engaged boutique investment bank Valence Group to solicit interest for its Sodium Borohydride unit, which could fetch more than $200 million, according to sources. Last year, Dow  agreed to sell its polypropylene licensing and catalysts business to smaller peer W.R. Grace & Co  for $500 million.

2014-11-20,https://www.reuters.com,Boston Scientific to pay $18.5 million in mesh case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp was ordered Thursday to pay $18.5 million for injuries caused by transvaginal mesh devices, a plaintiffs’ lawyer said, in the third courtroom loss for the company over the products.  A jury in West Virginia federal court found the Massachusetts company liable to four women following a 10-day trial, according to their lawyer, Doug Monsour. The company was ordered to pay each of the four women damages ranging from $3.25 million to $4.25 million for the injuries.  Jurors also said Boston Scientific had acted with “gross negligence” and awarded each woman $1 million in punitive damages, Monsour said.  “This jury, after carefully thinking about the evidence for two days, came to the proper decision that this was a defective product,” Monsour said.  Boston Scientific, whose shares fell 1.5 percent to $12.90, said in a statement that it disagreed with the verdict and was considering its appeals options.  The four plaintiffs say they suffered injuries such as pain during sex, nerve damage and infection as a result of the company’s Obtryx device, which is used to treat stress urinary incontinence.  Their claims are among more than 24,000 in U.S. state and federal courts against Boston Scientific over mesh devices. Plaintiffs’ lawyers said at trial that Boston Scientific failed to perform sufficient safety testing in its rush to bring mesh products to market. They accused the company of using polypropylene to make the devices despite warnings that it was not meant to be permanently implanted in humans, and neglecting to tell doctors and women about those risks.  Boston Scientific has fought back against claims that the devices are defective or were to blame for the women’s complications.  Last week, a Miami federal jury returned a $26.7 million verdict against Boston Scientific following a trial involving claims from four women over its Pinnacle device for treating pelvic organ prolapse. It did not award punitive damages. Earlier, a jury in Texas ordered the company to pay $73 million, which was later reduced to $34 million, in another mesh trial. Boston Scientific, however, won its first two mesh trials in Massachusetts state court.  Boston Scientific is among seven major defendants, also including C.R. Bard and Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon Inc, that together are facing more than 60,000 mesh lawsuits in federal court.

Jurors also said Boston Scientific had acted with “gross negligence” and awarded each woman $1 million in punitive damages, Monsour said. “This jury, after carefully thinking about the evidence for two days, came to the proper decision that this was a defective product,” Monsour said. Boston Scientific, whose shares fell 1.5 percent to $12.90, said in a statement that it disagreed with the verdict and was considering its appeals options. The four plaintiffs say they suffered injuries such as pain during sex, nerve damage and infection as a result of the company’s Obtryx device, which is used to treat stress urinary incontinence. Their claims are among more than 24,000 in U.S. state and federal courts against Boston Scientific over mesh devices. Plaintiffs’ lawyers said at trial that Boston Scientific failed to perform sufficient safety testing in its rush to bring mesh products to market. They accused the company of using polypropylene to make the devices despite warnings that it was not meant to be permanently implanted in humans, and neglecting to tell doctors and women about those risks. Boston Scientific has fought back against claims that the devices are defective or were to blame for the women’s complications. Last week, a Miami federal jury returned a $26.7 million verdict against Boston Scientific following a trial involving claims from four women over its Pinnacle device for treating pelvic organ prolapse. It did not award punitive damages. Earlier, a jury in Texas ordered the company to pay $73 million, which was later reduced to $34 million, in another mesh trial. Boston Scientific, however, won its first two mesh trials in Massachusetts state court. Boston Scientific is among seven major defendants, also including C.R. Bard and Johnson & Johnson’s  Ethicon Inc, that together are facing more than 60,000 mesh lawsuits in federal court.

2014-11-21,https://www.reuters.com,Singapore Exchange to launch petrochemical derivatives,"SINGAPORE, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Singapore Exchange  said on Friday it will launch five petrochemical swaps and futures in the next two months to meet rising demand for risk management in the industry. The exchange will start swaps and futures contracts for paraxylene (PX) delivered to China on Dec. 2 and another four polyolefins contracts on Jan. 19, it said in a statement. The polyolefins contracts are for linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and for polypropylene (PP) flat yarn delivered to China and Southeast Asia, SGX said. “Given the volatile nature of the market, these new swaps and futures contracts aim to provide a more effective hedging instrument for petrochemical industry participants in the Asia PX, PP and PE physical markets,” the exchange said. The PX, PP and polyethylene (PE) markets are estimated to have grown to 45 million tonnes, 23 million tonnes and 35 million tonnes, respectively, with China consuming the most, SGX added. ICIS will be the index provider for the polyolefin contracts, SGX said, while the PX contract will be cash settled against the Platts index.

2015-03-09,https://www.reuters.com,UPDATE 2-Veolia buys Dutch firm AKG in waste recycling push,"(Rewrites first paragraph, adds detail on plastics recycling and investment plans) By Geert De Clercq PARIS, Sept 3 (Reuters) - French water and waste group Veolia Environnement has bought a majority stake in Dutch plastics recycling company AKG Kunststof as part of a strategy to grow in waste recycling. Veolia declined to say how much it paid for AKG, bought from private equity firm Wadinko, but Chief Executive Antoine Frerot told Reuters on Thursday it was less than AKG’s 34 million euros ($38 million) revenue in 2014. Wadinko will keep a small stake and a seat on AKG’s board. Frerot said that while the investment in AKG is relatively small for Veolia, which has a market capitalisation of more than 12 billion euros, AKG’s recycling technologies have huge potential for wider application. AKG recycles polypropylene plastics from industrial and household waste, from which it makes polypropylene granulates that it sells to manufacturers of plastic products. Strong and heat-resistant, polypropylene is one of the most commonly used plastics in everything from the lids of Tic Tac mint boxes to microwave-resistant food containers. The recycled plastic, which has the same qualities as new plastic produced by the petrochemical industry, is used for flower pots and garden products, and in the automotive, infrastructure and white goods industries. Frerot said AKG also has an innovative technology to recover different kinds of plastic from household waste, by floating ground-up plastic waste in water and separating it by density with a proprietary technology partly based on magnetism. Frerot said plastics recycling is difficult and that at the moment only plastic water bottles made from polyethylene are easily recyclable. The rest is mostly incinerated or buried in landfill. “The AKG plastics sorting technology is simple and cheap,” Frerot said, adding that Veolia plans to roll it out in other countries. It will build sorting facilities in cities where it can source a steady stream of plastics waste, and find buyers for the recycled material. Veolia, which collects some 370,000 tonnes of plastic waste per year, will boost the capacity of AKG’s plant at the Dutch town of Vroomshoop to 75,000 tonnes per year from 34,000 tonnes. Frerot said a new plant with a 75,000 tonne capacity would represent an investment of 15 to 20 million euros. He said Veolia will continue to focus on organic or self-generated growth, but is ready to make more similar acquisitions that can boost its recycling technologies.

2015-03-30,https://www.reuters.com,Fluor to manage Azeri petrochemical plant construction,"BAKU, March 30 (Reuters) - A subsidiary of Fluor Corp.  will manage the construction of Azerbaijan’s new $16.5 billion oil, gas and petrochemicals processing plant, the U.S. Embassy in the former Soviet republic said. The new complex will replace Azeri state energy company SOCAR’s two ageing downstream refineries - the Baku and Azerneftyag oil refineries - as well as the Garadagh gas processing plant and the facilities of chemicals firm Azerikimya. It will be built at Sangachal, 60 kilometres (37 miles) south of Baku, where Azerbaijan’s main oil and gas pipelines reach the Caspian Sea. Fluor Ltd., which was chosen by SOCAR via tender, is a unit of Fluor Corp, one of the world’s largest publicly traded engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and project management companies. Fluor will choose subcontractors to carry out engineering works. SOCAR said last week it would ask the oil-rich country’s central bank for a 10-year loan worth 1 billion manats ($952 million). The money is needed for the first stage of the project, which is estimated to cost $2.1 billion. Construction is expected to begin at the end of this year and be completed by 2020. SOCAR said last year it had delayed the completion date of the complex by four years until 2030 due to a lack of funds. Within the complex, a gas processing plant and a petrochemicals plant are due to be completed by 2020 instead of 2017, and an oil refinery by 2030 instead of 2026. Industry sources say the new petrochemical complex will allow the country to profit from processing oil rather than just exporting it. SOCAR hopes that investment firms and private companies will provide 70 percent of the funds for the project, and the rest will be financed by SOCAR and Azerbaijan’s $37 billion state oil fund. Once completed, annual oil refinery capacity will rise to 8 million tonnes of crude, from 6 million tonnes. The gas processing plant is expected to have an annual capacity of 12 billion cubic metres (bcm), while the petrochemical plant will produce about 800,000 tonnes of polyethylene and 300,000 tonnes of polypropylene.

2015-04-23,https://www.reuters.com,'Safest bike ever' devised by British entrepreneur,"LONDON, ENGLAND, UNITED KINGDOM, APRIL 20, 2015 -  A British entrepreneur has designed what he calls ‘the safest bike in history’ and hopes its manufacture could help those currently reluctant to cycle, due to safety concerns, to get in the saddle. Crispin Sinclair and his team have created the Babel Bike, which they are seeking to fund via crowd-sourcing website Indigoego. According to Sinclair, the Babel’s protective cage positioned around the rider, combined with a double seatbelt and host of other safety features make it very safe. “The main feature is the safety cage with the seatbelt, and the idea is that it’s wide enough that it won’t go under the side of a lorry, of a modern bus or lorry, so it gets pushed away instead, and also if you’re hit by a car it’s effectively the same as a car roll cage. It’s also got on the final version wing mirrors, indicators, hazard flashers, and a loud horn,” said Sinclair. In large cities like London one of the biggest dangers for cyclists is being struck by a lorry, often without the lorry driver even being aware that a collision has occurred. This is usually because the cyclist has appeared in his so-called ‘blind spot’. In addition to the protective cage stopping the cyclist from being crushed against railings or another vehicle, the Babel’s automatic horn - as loud as a car horn - alerts a lorry driver to the accident. “As soon as it’s hit it triggers the alarm which sounds like a loud car horn and that immediately tells the lorry driver that he’s got somebody in the blind spot,” explained Sinclair. “One of the big problems at the moment is that even when you’ve been hit often the driver doesn’t know and they just carry on down the road.” Sinclair’s assistant Esteban Diaz conducted a series of tests in which a dummy strapped into the Babel was struck in a series of staged collisions by a 38-tonne goods vehicle. “We hired a lorry and we placed the prototype. We made the lorry turn and we saw how it reacts with the safety frame, so the safety frame was made of aluminium, aluminium tubing, and it turns out that it never gets underneath the lorry. It always gets pushed away and even dragged away it never puts the rider in a dangerous position, which is close to the wheels,” said Diaz. Additional safety features include steel foot protectors, automatically-activated head and tail lights, plus hazard and brake lights. The inventor isn’t the first Sinclair to have tried his hand at designing vehicle. His father Sir Clive Sinclair, who became famous for launching the Sinclair ZX range of home computers in the early 1980s, launched the Sinclair C5 electric vehicle in 1985, but it failed to impress consumers. A small open-topped vehicle made of polypropylen, potential buyers felt exposed to both inclement weather and heavy traffic. Seven years later he launched the lightweight electric bicycle Zike, which also flopped, despite seemingly being ahead of its time. Sinclair says his father hasn’t been involved in the Babel’s development, but admits that growing up with an inventor has inevitably influenced him. “My father Clive Sinclair is obviously famous for his computers in the early days and obviously the C5 back in the 80s,” he said. “This particular project has kind of been my own, but I guess growing up with someone who makes and invents products and takes it all the way through to production I guess that’s inevitably an influence on the way I’ve done the business.” The Babel bike will be manufactured in both pedal-electric and fully human-powered models. It includes a handlebar smartphone mount, and a security package that includes a Kryptonite U-lock. The pedal-electric model includes a 250-watt Shimano STEPS motor, powered by a removable 36-volt 11.6-Ah lithium-ion battery. A full four-hour charge will allow riders to travel between 50 and 80 miles (80-129 kilometres). It has a top electric-assist speed of 20 mph (32 km/h). A pledge of ?2,999 ($4,430 USD) will buy an electric model, while ?1,999 ($2,950 USD) will secure a non-electric version. The bikes will subsequently be around 25 percent more expensive once the initial buyers have received their vehicles.

2015-04-23,https://www.reuters.com,"MIDEAST WEEKAHEAD-Oil, competition, Mobily hit Saudi earnings before bourse opens to foreigners","* Petchems, telecoms miss Q1 estimates * Banks outperform, cement makers match forecasts * Strong dollar hurts top consumer name Savola * But analysts hope petchems have bottomed out * Banks face tougher competition By Olzhas Auyezov DUBAI, April 23 (Reuters) - Despite a strong performance by banks, Saudi Arabia’s first-quarter corporate earnings were generally weaker than expected, a sign that foreign investors should be cautious as the stock market opens up to them this year. The Capital Market Authority has said the $552 billion market will open to direct foreign investment on June 15. Currently, foreigners can only invest through swaps and exchange-traded funds, which can be inconvenient and expensive. Potential foreign interest in the market is intense. But despite huge long-term potential, Saudi corporate earnings currently face headwinds that had a big impact on first-quarter results, a Reuters analysis shows. Total first-quarter profit of 12 listed petrochemicals firms more than halved year-on-year because of the plunge of oil prices since last June, which has dragged down petrochemical product prices and hurt margins. Combined profit was 16.8 percent below the average forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, even though Saudi Basic Industries, the biggest firm in the sector and in the entire bourse, beat estimates with a 38.9 percent profit drop. Shrinking earnings at petrochemical firms were the main reason for a drop of total profits at all listed Saudi companies combined in the first quarter. They fell 22 percent year-on-year to 21.9 billion riyals ($5.8 billion), according to calculations by local news website Argaam.com. Since the end of last month, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters have cut their outlook for the petrochemical sector’s profit in all of 2015 by 3.4 percent - though that mostly reflects adjustments for the first-quarter misses, while expectations for the rest of the year are intact. Combined petrochemical profits are now expected to drop  12.5 percent in 2015, implying a recovery later this year - though that will depend very much on the uncertain direction of oil prices. “We believe that the petrochemical product prices, in general, have bottomed out, unless pressured by a further decline in oil prices from the current levels,” NBK Capital said in a research note this week. “Over the past month, polyethylene and polypropylene prices increased by 8 and 10 percent respectively, while the mono ethylene glycol price has increased by 6 percent.” TELECOMS, RETAIL The telecommunications sector illustrates another form of risk in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Telecom and Zain Saudi  beat expectations in the first quarter, but Mobily  posted a shock loss as a scandal over its misstatement of earnings continued to reverberate. This caused the sector’s overall profit to tumble 41 percent. Since March, analysts have cut their 2015 outlook for the sector by 2.1 percent. They now expect profits to increase 63.6 percent for the full year, but that is based on hopes that Mobily will turn profitable; more cuts to forecasts may follow as some analysts are still reviewing their Mobily models. In the consumer sector, profits at retailers surged during the first quarter because of the payment of two months’ salary as a bonus to public sector workers to mark King Salman’s accession in January. For example, Jarir Marketing  reported an estimate-beating 23 percent rise in profit and raised its quarterly dividend. But as the special factor of the bonus payment fades, the rest of the year may not be quite as strong. Analysts expect 20 percent growth for Jarir’s full-year profit. Meanwhile, analysts have cut their average forecast for the full-year profit of leading food maker Savola after it posted a sharp drop in first-quarter earnings, excluding one-off gains, and said profits in the second-quarter would also fall year-on-year. The company said exchange rate movements were one of the reasons for weaker overseas sales - a factor which looks likely to affect other Saudi exporters this year. The Saudi riyal  is pegged to the strengthening U.S. dollar. CEMENT, BANKS Saudi cement makers posted a 3.5 percent increase in combined first-quarter profits, which was in line with expectations and indicated that government spending, which underpins demand for construction materials, remains strong. However, while the government has pledged to keep spending high and has ample fiscal reserves to do so, many analysts still expect a moderate decrease in new construction projects in Saudi Arabia this year as cheap oil makes planners more cautious. The value of new projects awarded in Saudi Arabia during the first quarter of this year fell 10 percent from the previous quarter, analysts at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank said in a report. This may mean a little less business for cement firms later in the year; analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect a 4.0 decrease in combined profits for all of 2015. Banks, which accounted for about half of total stock market earnings in the first quarter because of petrochemicals’ weakness, posted a 5.4 percent increase in profits and were 8.2 percent ahead of estimates. But analysts have remained cautious with full-year forecasts and have downgraded them for several lenders, most notably for leading retail bank Al Rajhi which, unlike all other names in the sector, posted a drop in first-quarter profit because of new regulations limiting consumer finance fees. For all of 2015, analysts expect an increase of just 1.6 percent in combined bank earnings. “The Saudi economy expanded by 3.6 percent during 2014, outperforming 2013’s 2.7 percent, based on 2010 prices. This constituted the framework for the stellar performance recorded by the domestic banking system,” National Commercial Bank, the kingdom’s top lender, said in a report last week. “However, given the current developments in the domestic economy, we expect the banking system to moderate this year and register smaller growth rates...In our opinion, the banking system will continue to rise on growing volumes, yet competition on diminishing margins will intensify.”   (Editing by Andrew Torchia)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based LCV Capital Management plans to re-purpose two disused factories and create about 1,000 jobs, the ministry said in a statement. New production and jobs would be warmly welcomed at the sites in the Calabria and Puglia regions which, along with the rest of Italy’s southern “Mezzogiorno” have suffered seven straight years of recession and stubbornly high unemployment. The plan, which was ratified on Wednesday after a preliminary agreement in July, foresees total investment of more than 200 million euros ($224.8 million), 84 million euros of which will be used to refurbish the factories. The central government has pledged more than 50 million euros and the two regional administrations will invest a combined sum of around 16 million euros in the project. LCV, which usually invests in U.S.-listed companies in various sectors, plans to re-employ hundreds of people who had been on temporary jobless schemes, the ministry said. Presenting the project in Rome earlier this year, LCV said a weaker euro against the dollar made producing in Europe attractive, and the company chose Italy because of its disused production facilities and labour force skilled in the sector. The new car will have a “reduced impact on the environment”, the government said. LCV said in its presentation it would be about 30 percent lighter than other vehicles in its class and built of steel and polypropylene. $1 = 0.8897 euros

2015-07-11,https://www.reuters.com,REFILE-Brazil's Petrobras says Braskem naphtha extension worth $252 mln,"(Edits headline) SAO PAULO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA said on Friday two amendments to its contract to supply naphtha to Braskem SA, Latin America’s largest petrochemical company are worth 950 million reais ($252 million). The contract amendments extend the terms of an agreement for Petrobras, as the oil company is known, to supply Braskem  with naphtha, a petrochemical feedstock, to Braskem operations in the Brazilian states of S?o Paulo, Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul for 45 days starting Nov 1. Petrobras owns 36 percent of Braskem’s total shares and 47 percent of its voting stock. “Petrobras maintains discussions with Braskem, seeking in these talks a naphtha price that reflects balanced commercial and exchange conditions for both companies, referencing international market prices for petroleum derivatives,” Petrobras said in a statement. Petrobras and Braskem have been negotiating a multi-billion-dollar naphtha-supply contract for months. A lack of a final agreement has led to a series of temporary extension agreements. Braskem, with 36 plants, 29 in Brazil and the rest abroad, including factories in the United States and Germany, is controlled by Brazil’s Odebrecht Group. Odebrecht is one of about two dozen construction and industrial companies involved in a giant price-fixing, bribery and political kickback scandal that has cost Petrobras and its government and non-government investors billions of dollars. Braskem depends on naphtha from Petrobras to operate its Brazilian plants, the dominant supplier of polyethylene, polypropylene and poly-vinyl-chloride (PVC) to Brazil, the world’s seventh-largest economy. Marcelo Odebrecht, the chief executive of Odebrecht, has been in held in jail since June for questioning about his alleged role in the Petrobras corruption scandal. Petrobras, facing serious financial difficulties in the wake of the scandal and more than $130 billion of debt, the largest of any oil company, is under pressure to force Braskem to accept less favorable naphtha-purchase terms, terms more in line with international market prices. Braskem’s Brazilian plants, though, are in regions where Brazil’s government, Petrobras’ controlling shareholder, is keen to preserve jobs, making the naphtha contract politically sensitive. The scandal at Petrobras, and related investment and job cuts, has helped deepen Brazil’s worst recession in decades. On Wednesday Petrobras said it agreed to buy 82,000 cubic meters (515,764 barrels) of gasoline from Braskem, bolstering supplies of the fuel as Petrobras faces its biggest strike in 20 years. $1 = 3.7698 Brazilian reais

2015-07-20,https://www.reuters.com,"False dawn? China economy steadies, but some fear it won't last","KUNSHAN/BEIJING, China (Reuters) - Business is roaring at Qiu Bangsheng’s factory in eastern China, where whizzing machines churn out long, white strips of polypropylene that are rolled into cylinders and turned into nappies and other hygiene products. Labourers work at a construction site for a new building in Shanghai, March 5, 2015. REUTERS/Aly Song For Premier Li Keqiang and China’s top economic policymakers, who have been at pains to contain a downturn that is likely to be the worst in 25 years, stories like Qiu’s are exactly what they want to hear. “Companies reported an improvement in business conditions in June and the property sector is warming up,” said a researcher at the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s powerful economic planner, who asked not to be identified. “It seems that Premier Li is happy.” The question is whether Qiu’s success shows the unexpected stabilisation in growth during the second quarter was a signal of an inflection point for the world’s second-largest economy, or merely reflects a government which remains wedded to hitting an arbitrary target that fails to address long-term imbalances. Data last week showed China defying hard times to maintain a growth rate of 7 percent in the first six months, bang in line with Beijing’s full-year target. Some economists have long been sceptical about China’s official data, although the country’s statistics bureau said last week its numbers were accurate and rejected suggestions they could be inflated. Other analysts fear the figure, if not embellished, was masking crucial weaknesses. Growth in trade, investment, output and retail sales - mainstays of the economy - remained sluggish despite three interest rate cuts this year, they said, curtailed by a firm yuan and a still-wobbly housing sector. “I’m not very optimistic about economic growth in the second half,” said Wang Jun, a senior economist at the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE), a well-connected think-tank.    Indeed, it was a boom in the financial industry - the fastest-growing sector in the second quarter - that boosted services growth, momentum that is expected to have now fizzled on the back of a June stock market crash.   That means further policy easing and support may be needed to meet this year’s official target. A FRAGILE STABILISATION Qiu knows his firm’s success is due in part to central and local government support, including subsidies, and he notes  smaller factories that are unable to upgrade are going out of business.

2015-08-27,https://www.reuters.com,UPDATE 1-Czech Pegas says does not expect impact from Unipetrol stoppage,"(Adds comment on chance of longer stoppage) PRAGUE, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Czech artificial fabrics maker Pegas Nonwovens is on the “safe side” with raw material supplies for now despite a stoppage of production at supplier Unipetrol, Pegas’s chief executive said on Thursday. A fire earlier this month halted petrochemical production at Czech downstream oil group Unipetrol’s plant and the company said on Thursday a resumption of full production was still a matter of months. When asked about the impact on Pegas, CEO Frantisek Rezac said the company had the support of other suppliers and also had its own safety stock of raw materials and finished products. “Even without this production we will have enough material in September and we will be still keeping our standard level of safety stock,” he said on a call with analysts. “And we have promises from other suppliers to continue with support when we will need it. It means now that we are on the safe side.” Rezac said he did not believe the company would be without a supply of polypropylene, even if the stoppage lasted three months. He said a longer stoppage could affect prices but that this was not his expectation. “If (there is) no production at Unipetrol maybe it would impact our purchase price, it might be a little bit higher ... But I don’t expect this situation,” he said. Pegas reported earlier on Thursday a 9.6 percent drop in second-quarter core earnings to 8.9 million euros ($10.1 million) due to a rise in polymer prices and the revaluation of a share option plan. The company reiterated that it expected full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 44.0 million to 48.5 million euros in 2015.

2015-08-31,https://www.reuters.com,MIDEAST STOCKS-Gulf markets fall on oil; Egypt jumps after gas find,"* Gulf markets continue to track oil prices
    * Saudi Arabia posts worst month since October 2008
    * Qatar outperforms on MSCI index weighting increase
    * Egypt jumps on potentially huge gas field discovery
    * Weaker oil also positive for Cairo stocks

    By Olzhas Auyezov
    DUBAI, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Most Gulf stock markets fell on
Monday, tracking volatile oil prices, while Egypt's bourse
jumped after energy major Eni announced a potentially huge
natural gas discovery off the country's coast.
    The main Saudi Arabian stock index dropped 2.2
percent, closing August with a 17.3 percent loss, its biggest
monthly drop since October 2008. Like other Gulf markets, it
swung wildly during the month in response to oil price changes;
at its bottom on Aug. 24, the benchmark was 30.9 percent down
month-to-date.
    All sectors fell on Monday as Brent oil dipped back below
$49 a barrel, pressured by a supply glut and renewed concern
about a hard landing for China's economy. 
    Al Tayyar Travel tumbled 5.7 percent after the
firm said its founder Nasser bin Aqeel al-Tayyar would resign as
vice-chairman and managing director from Sept. 1.
 
    News that Saudi Arabia's real gross domestic product growth
accelerated to 3.8 percent year-on-year in the second quarter
from 2.3 percent in the first, hitting its fastest rate since
the first quarter of 2014, failed to improve market sentiment.
 
    Analysts expect growth to slow in coming quarters as there
will be relatively little room for further oil output increases
and consumer spending, boosted by one-off payouts linked to King
Salman's accession to the throne in January, may also cool off.
    Elsewhere in the Gulf, Dubai's index fell 0.7
percent with most stocks in the red. But property developer
DAMAC, the most traded stock, jumped 2.1 percent
ahead of a Sept. 15 shareholder meeting which will vote on the
firm's first cash dividend payout since its listing in the
emirate in January.
    Dubai's index closed August 11.6 percent lower; it was down
17.9 percent month-to-date at its Aug. 24 low.
    Abu Dhabi's benchmark, on the other hand, climbed 0.9
percent on Monday, supported by banks. First Gulf Bank 
surged 3.2 percent and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank was
up 1.8 percent.
    
    QATAR, EGYPT
    Qatar's bourse outperformed the Gulf, gaining 2
percent thanks to upcoming adjustments to MSCI's emerging
markets index.
    Property developer Ezdan Holding, one of the
stocks whose weighting in the benchmark is increasing from Sept.
1, surged 7.8 percent. Passively managed funds, which replicate
indexes, usually adjust their positions on the last trading day
before index reviews take effect.
    Commercial Bank of Qatar, another Doha stock whose
weighting is set to increase, gained 4 percent.
    Egypt's bourse, which had initially edged down on
Monday in line with other emerging markets, erased its losses
and jumped 2.8 percent.
    Ezz Steel was the top gainer, surging to its daily
10 percent limit after Eni announced the discovery of a natural
gas field off the Egyptian coast on Sunday, which it said might
prove able to meet the country's energy needs for decades.
 
    As a major energy consumer, Ezz Steel is suffering from gas
shortages, and a boost to supply could allow it to ramp up
production, analysts said.
    ""We consider this development could potentially translate
into a re-rating of all the major energy-intensive companies in
the country,"" NBK Capital said in a note on Monday.
    ""Over the past two years, gas unavailability has translated
into significant lower operating rates and/or shrinking margins
across the industries, specifically fertilisers, steel and
cement.""
    Another big gainer was carpet maker Oriental Weavers
, which surged 9 percent. Polypropylene, which is used
to make fibers and is one of the firm's main cost components, is
produced from oil and will become cheaper if crude remains
depressed.
    Also aiding overall investor sentiment, Egypt on Sunday
announced it would hold a long-awaited parliamentary election in
two phases starting on Oct. 18-19, the final step of a roadmap
to formal democracy.
            
    MONDAY'S HIGHLIGHTS
    
    SAUDI ARABIA
    * The index dropped 2.2 percent to 7,522 points.
    
    DUBAI
    * The index edged down 0.7 percent to 3,663 points.
    
    ABU DHABI
    * The index edged up 0.9 percent to 4,494 points.
    
    QATAR
    * The index jumped 2.0 percent to 11,564 points.
    
    EGYPT
    * The index jumped 2.8 percent to 7,252 points.
    
    KUWAIT
    * The index fell 1.4 percent to 5,821 points.
    
    OMAN
    * The index lost 0.6 percent to 5,872 points.

2015-10-26,https://www.reuters.com,Sumitomo wins $300 mln order for gas-fired plant in Turkmenistan,"TOKYO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Trading house Sumitomo Corp  said on Monday it had won a $300 million order for a 400-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Turkmenistan, part of a package of deals announced on a visit to the Central Asian nation by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japan and Turkmenistan on Friday signed deals worth over $18 billion in the energy-rich nation, which has become an important supplier of natural gas to China. Sumitomo said it aimed to complete the construction of the simple-cycle gas-fired plant in 2018, and that the main equipment such as a gas turbine and power generator would be procured from Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Ltd. Turkmenistan, a reclusive nation of 5.5 million, holds the world’s fourth-largest reserves of natural gas. Since independence in 1991, it has launched ambitious projects to process the commodity at home and find new export routes. Japan’s Abe last week started a tour of the five post-Soviet Central Asian nations where former imperial master Russia and China are vying for clout. Japanese companies are already involved in large-scale projects in Turkmenistan, building plants to process natural gas into fertilisers, ethylene, polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as into liquid fuel.

2015-11-25,https://www.reuters.com,Oman completes $4.5 bln contract talks for plastics complex,"MUSCAT, Nov 25 (Reuters) - State-owned Oman Oil Refineries and Petroleum Industries Co (ORPIC) said it had finalised negotiations with preferred bidders for $4.5 billion worth of contracts to build a major plastics complex in the sultanate. The four engineering, procurement and contracting packages will be completed in four years, with plants to be commissioned in 2019, ORPIC said in a statement on Wednesday. A joint venture of Chicago Bridge & Iron Co of the United States and Taiwan’s CTCI will be awarded the contract for a steam cracker and utilities, ORPIC said. In a separate statement, Chicago Bridge & Iron said that contract would be worth about $2.8 billion. Italy’s Tecnimont will win a contract for plastics units, South Korea’s GS Engineering and Construction  and Japan’s Mitsui & Co a contract for natural gas liquids extraction facilities, and India’s Punj Lloyd  a contract for a pipelime, ORPIC said. The Liwa Plastics Project, being built in Oman’s northern port city of Sohar, is a big part of the sultanate’s effort to diversify its economy away from hydrocarbons. It is designed to enable Oman to produce polyethylene for the first time, and to increase its output of polypropylene. ORPIC chief executive Musab al-Mahruqi said he expected to sign the contracts and financing deals by the end of this year. “We are concluding discussions with export credit agencies, commercial banks and other relevant authorities and we expect to finalise the project funding plan by the end of the year, enabling us to award the respective EPC contracts.” Previously, ORPIC said it would borrow money to finance 70 percent of construction of the complex, while the remaining 30 percent would come in the form of equity from the company.

2015-11-26,https://www.reuters.com,UPDATE 1-Saudi Aramco to invest more in Indonesia's oil and gas sector,"(Updates throughout) By Wilda Asmarini CILACAP, INDONESIA, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco is looking for further investment opportunities in Indonesia’s downstream refining and petrochemicals industry, the company’s CEO said on Thursday, after initiating a $5.5 billion project to upgrade the country’s largest refinery. The Saudi Aramco CEO’s comments are positive for Indonesian President Joko Widodo’s efforts to attract investment after a clean-up of the country’s oil and gas sector that followed a series of scandals. “Indonesia is an important country for Saudi Arabia, a rising global economy, we would like to be a part of the growth of Indonesia,” Saudi Aramco CEO Amin H Al-Nasser said at the signing of the initial agreement to upgrade the Cilacap refinery in Indonesia’s Central Java province. Indonesia will rejoin OPEC as its 13th member nation next month. The project is expected to increase the refinery’s crude processing capacity to 370,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 348,000 bpd at present, and is also likely to include an agreement to import crude from Saudi Arabia, the world’s top crude exporter. The upgrade will include a new hydro cracker unit, as well as units to increase production of paraxylene and polypropylene production, according to a Pertamina statement. “It’s a great opportunity for growth in a global market,” Nasser said. “We’re hoping this is the start.” Aramco was also expected to join a tender to develop a greenfield refinery project in East Java, Wiratmaja Puja, Indonesia’s director general of oil and gas, said. Further details on a strategic partnership between Aramco and Indonesia’s state energy company Pertamina have yet to be finalised, including how a joint venture between the two will be shared. Indonesia broke off talks on building two refineries with Aramco and Kuwait Petroleum in 2014 due to a disagreement over taxes and fiscal terms. Brent crude trading at $45 a barrel may have helped restore investor interest in Indonesia’s downstream sector as Saudi Arabia and other oil companies move to secure markets. Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s top producer, has rebuffed calls to cut output in an effort to support prices, and is instead focused on defending market share. Nasser said Aramco would meet its customers’ demands.   (Writing by Fergus Jensen; Editing by Randy Fabi and Jane Merriman)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
2015-12-20,https://www.reuters.com,"Brazil ditches standard jute coffee bags, leading move toward bulk","* Move aims to contain costs in tough market * Super sacks preserve flavor better than jute * Mechanization to limit manual labor to niche coffee markets By Reese Ewing SANTOS, Brazil, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The humble jute bag, long the distinctive packing for Brazil’s coffee exports, is rapidly being edged out as traders and cooperatives face rising wage bills and borrowing costs, weak global prices and a deepening economic crisis at home. By introducing massive plastic sacks to replace the 60-kg (132-lb) jute bags that have dominated coffee shipments for more than two centuries, firms are saving millions of dollars a year, in a move so successful it is expected to reshape the global industry. Until a few years ago, the world’s biggest coffee producer dispatched nearly all its exports in jute bags. Next year will see Brazil export more than half its green coffee in 1-tonne polypropylene ‘super sacks’ or 21.6-tonne polyethylene liners. Dinamo, the largest coffee warehouse at the port of Santos, said super sacks accounted for 30 percent of its exports in 2015 and are growing by 5 percent a year. Brazil’s biggest coffee cooperative Cooxupe has nearly eliminated jute. “It’s the future,” said trader Mauricio Di Cunto at exporter Comexim, which ships half its coffee in bulk. “It lets us be more aggressive in offering discounts without the cost of jute.” The 60-kg jute bag has been a standard unit of  measurement for coffee trading since Brazil started commercial  production of the bean in the 18th century. The grains and sugar sectors long ago moved to bulk, but coffee has been a laggard. National data on exports in super sacks is not yet available but exporters association Cecafe is due to start monitoring their use from January. The growth in bulk handling reflects a plunge in manual laborers lifting coffee bags. Higher wages and stricter regulations, which expose industry to worker-injury lawsuits, are hastening the decline. The calculation is compelling: one worker with a forklift can fill a container with super sacks in 25 minutes, while 9 men need nearly an hour with jute. Loading a liner is even faster as beans are dumped in loose. It costs 22 to 40 centavos every time a worker hoists a 60-kg bag to fill a container or weigh it. Brazil produces 50-60 million bags of coffee a year. On the cobble-stoned streets of Santos, a port that rose to fame with Brazil’s coffee boom, a small team of lifters gathered recently in the morning light at the entrance of the Dinamo warehouse, one of two that still handles coffee at the port. “We used to have 59 lifters on a shift, now we have nine,” union leader and former lifter Carlos Roberto Lima reflected. The move to bulk treatment of coffee is taking place as global raw materials prices fall with slower demand growth in emerging markets like China. The price of coffee, which is Brazil’s sixth most valuable commodity export, has fallen by more than 60 percent from highs in 2011 to $1.17/lb. SILVER LINERS International Coffee Organization Executive Director Roberio Oliveira said the move to bulk is helping Brazil adapt to just-in-time logistics to manage stocks better as prices decline. “This is still mostly a Brazilian development,” Oliveira said, adding that he expects other exporters to follow. Big roasters like Starbucks Corp, Folgers  and Maxwell House were the first to receive lined containers almost a decade ago. Since then, liners, which Cecafe has monitored since 2007, have grown to account for half of Brazil’s green coffee exports, said the association’s technical director Eduardo Heron Santos. A lined 20-foot container holds 21.6 tonnes of coffee, while one with jute holds only 19.3 tonnes, said Alex Jairo Pinto, director at Dinamo. A container holds 20 tonnes in super sacks. Whether jute or bulk, the cost of shipping the container is the same, he said. “That’s one reason 60 percent of the coffee we ship is in liner and 30 percent in super sacks,” said Pinto. Cooxupe, which moves a tenth of Brazil’s crop, was one of the first to shift to bulk bags a few years ago, president of the co-op, Carlos Paulino da Costa said. “We have almost eliminated the jute bag,” he said, adding  it saves the co-op 18 million reais ($4.7 million) a year. Jute costs 4 reais ($1) a bag, plus a real to sew it up for reuse. The one-tonne super sack at 50-to-150 reais costs almost the same, equalizing for weights, but lasts twice as long. HARD HABITS Savings are still imperceptible for consumers as much of  what constitutes retail prices comes after beans leave traders’ hands, as costs for roasting, marketing and preparation. But they will get a better product, as plastic protects coffee better from the elements than jute. “The bulk bags help preserve coffee’s favor,” said Daniel Wolthers at trader Wolthers & Associates in Santos. “You won’t get the taste of the jute.” Super sacks, however, will not topple the 60-kg bag any time soon as the basic measurement for coffee, just as the bushel remains relevant as a measure, even though grains are traded in bulk. And the specialty coffee business, which reaps premiums for socially and environmentally differentiated beans, will be slow to shed its aesthetic attachment to jute, said Felipe Gurdian, green coffee buyer for Montreal-based Cooperative Coffees. Earthy-colored jute bags, with their coarse grain and pastel-shaded stamps of origin, convey a sense of a traditional product that comes from the land. “There’s still reluctance to adopt bigger bags for a nuanced product like specialty coffees,” Gurdian said.

2016-01-28,https://www.reuters.com,UPDATE 1-S-Oil sees healthy 2016 refining margins as oil demand grows,"* S-Oil says sees healthy refining margins in 2016 * Major risks are China economic slowdown, US rate hikes * S-Oil maximising gasoline output on high margins   (Adds more details, comments) By Meeyoung Cho SEOUL, Jan 28 (Reuters) - South Korea’s S-Oil Corp  sees 2016 refining margins staying healthy and Asian refiners will benefit from growing oil demand during this year that outpaces increases in refining capacity, the company said on Thursday. Surging refining margins for petroleum products helped boost fourth quarter 2015 net income to 80.6 billion won ($66.67 million) versus a loss of 272.2 billion won a year ago, the company said in an earnings statement to the Korea Exchange. Full year income was 676.6 billion won against a loss of 287.8 billion won a year ago. Refining margins in 2016 will stay healthy as global incremental oil demand will outpace new refining capacity additions during the year, S-Oil, the country’s third-largest refiner, said in the statement. The company cited forecasts calling for over 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of new demand in 2016 against only 406,000 bpd of new refining. Still, S-Oil considers major risks this year in the continuing Chinese economic slowdown and the potential for faster-than-expected U.S. interest rate hikes that could limit oil demand, said Ju-wan Bang, S-Oil’s head of finance, in a call on the earnings. “With oil prices already low at $25-$26 a barrel in terms of Dubai crude, we don’t expect oil prices to make additional weakness and accordingly hurt the company’s performance,” said Bang. “Yet if such risks continue long, it could slow down oil demand and worsen market margins,” Bang said, referring to the Chinese economic slowdown and U.S. rate hike factors. S-Oil is currently maximising gasoline output, as its margin is healthier than that of diesel, said Bang, adding that gasoline output will increase dramatically in 2018 once its expansion project is completed. The company will add a residual fuel oil upgrading system and an olefin production system through 2018 that will produce 405,000 tonnes per annum (TPA) polypropylene, 300,000 TPA of propylene oxide, and 21,000 bpd of gasoline. S-Oil plans to shut its No.1 crude distillation unit (CDU) and a residue fluid catalytic cracking unit this year for maintenance, without providing exact timeline for the shutdown, it said in the statement. After the shutdown, it expects higher 18,000 bpd more diesel production. S-Oil said on Wednesday that it had agreed to sell 1.34 trillion Korean won of oil products this year the trading arm of top shareholder Saudi Aramco, higher than sales of 1.2 trillion won contracted a year earlier.

2016-02-18,https://www.reuters.com,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Braskem boosts investment, ready to fire up Mexico plant","(Corrects 6th paragraph in Feb. 18 story to say UTEC is a high-performance polyethylene, not polypropylene) SAO PAULO, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Braskem SA, Latin America’s largest petrochemical company, plans to increase investment by more than 50 percent this year as it starts new production lines in Mexico and the United States, making the most of cheaper raw materials and a stronger dollar. The Brazilian company said in a filing on Thursday that it planned 3.66 billion Brazilian reais ($909 million) of capital spending in 2016. Last year Braskem invested 2.376 billion reais, 11 percent more than planned due to a currency swing.

In Brazil, a severe economic downturn could reduce demand for plastic resins by 4 percent or 5 percent this year, Fadigas told journalists, underscoring the importance of Braskem’s growing international footprint.

2016-04-26,https://www.reuters.com,China tries to tame animal spirits in commodity markets,"LONDON (Reuters) - Nearly 240 million tonnes of steel rebar traded on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) last Thursday.  Labors work on a pile of iron ore at a steel factory in Tangshan in China's Hebei Province November 3, 2015. Picture taken November 3, 2015.      That was equivalent to around a third of China’s steel production last year, not just of construction-destined rebar but of every imaginable type of steel product.  And if that sounds like a lot of steel, consider the fact that on March 10 this year trading volumes on the Dalian Exchange iron ore contract exceeded one billion tonnes, more than the combined annual output of Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Brazil’s Vale.  OK. So there’s an element of double-counting at work here since Chinese exchanges tend to include both sides of a trade in their volume figures.  But there’s no disguising the surge in speculative interest that has been sweeping across the spectrum of Chinese commodity contracts, from iron ore to corn to polypropylene.  The flood of money has propelled prices of commodities such as iron ore and steel rebar sharply higher.  Now, however, the authorities have moved to tame the animal spirits firing up Chinese markets with a series of measures such as raising margin requirements, hiking transaction fees and widening daily limits.  They seem to have done the immediate trick with volumes and prices losing some of their froth this week.  But there is a sense that Chinese investors, having once tasted the profitable elixir of trading commodities, are not going to be beaten back for long.  We may be witnessing the start of a whole new chapter in the long-running, stormy story of speculators versus real-world commodity supply chains.  Graphic on Dalian iron ore trading:  tmsnrt.rs/1respEz Graphic on Shanghai steel rebar trading: tmsnrt.rs/1ret3Sx Graphic on Shanghai aluminum trading:  tmsnrt.rs/1resUhT MEET THE NEW INVESTORS Gold has always been the investment of choice for retail money, both in the West and in China.  But in China speculative interest has been building for a while in markets that in the West have largely been shunned by the man in the street.  In January last year London copper slumped 11 percent in the space of two days after a concerted bear attack by Chinese funds on the ShFE contract.  It was the first time the London Metal Exchange, where activity is almost exclusively conducted by big industrial and financial players, found itself at the mercy of another market-place.  And those Chinese bears returned to attack copper on the short side in both July and November.  Western traders woke up to the existence of powerful Chinese hedge funds such as the exotically-named Shanghai Chaos.  And in November it wasn’t just copper that got hit. There were crowd selling surges in metals such as aluminum and lead, both of which had largely traded below the radar of most local investors.  The key change appears to have been the Chinese authorities’ clamp down on stocks trading last year in reaction to excessive volatility.  Chinese retail investors simply switched their focus to the commodities sector, laying the foundations for this year’s remarkable explosion in trading activity.  The measures taken to cool overheating markets reveal much about this new type of investor, one who trades on margin (now hiked across the board) and one who is in and out in the space of a day (no more commission discounts for Dalian iron ore day-traders).  REAL-WORLD CONSEQUENCES One of the reasons why the Chinese authorities are moving to try and tame run-away markets is because excessive speculation in commodities can quickly feed through into real-world consequences.  The bear attacks on industrial metals last November caused massive consternation among China’s own producers, who appealed for government help in the face of “malicious short-selling”.  There was frantic talk of concerted production cutbacks, emergency stock-piling and direct government assistance. With hindsight much of it amounted to price-signaling, a warning to short-sellers to back off, although in copper there was concrete government action in the form of purchases from the State Reserves Bureau.  This time around with investment surging on the long side, the real-world impact has been even more far-reaching.  There’s no doubt that Chinese players understood early the likely effects on the entire ferrous supply chain of renewed government stimulus in the form of credit expansion and infrastructure build. Prices of physical commodities were always going to react higher but the scale and the speed of the price rallies have been unprecedented.      The price of physical iron ore jumped by 20 percent on March 4 and it did so because of the rocketing price on the Dalian exchange, which in turn was being fed by the rocketing price of steel futures in Shanghai.  Steel rebar prices have lost some of their froth but are still trading at levels last seen in January 2015.  The result has been the wholesale reactivation of idled steel production in China. National output jumped from an annualized 736 million tonnes in February to 832 million tonnes in March. Not only does this run counter to Beijing’s own policy about phasing out surplus steel capacity but it is intensely problematic in the context of escalating criticism and accumulating trade sanctions from other steel-producing countries.  But such, apparently, is the cumulative power of the Dalian and Shanghai day-traders.  JUST THE BEGINNING?  It’s ironic that Chinese investors have just found the commodities space when Western investors have lost much of their previous appetite.  Western retail investors never really embraced the host of new products launched at the turn of the decade, preferring to stick with tried and trusted vehicles such as gold exchange-traded funds.  Wholesale investors, meanwhile, became disillusioned both with the theoretical arguments of commodities as portfolio stabilizers and with the more prosaic collapse in commodity prices from their early-decade peaks.  Barclays Capital estimates that assets under management in the commodities sector ended last year at around $160 billion, the lowest level since 2007.  The investment baton, as it were, has been passed to the Chinese investor, who has easier and cheaper access to commodity markets and cares less whether it’s corn or copper as long as it’s moving in the right direction.  And although the day-traders might well take fright at the raft of weapons being used by the country’s exchanges, there’s a sense that the real investment trend in commodities has only just got going.  China’s giant mutual fund industry, estimated to have managed 8.4 trillion yuan ($1.3 trillion) by the end of last year, is showing increasing interest in diversifying away from turbulent stock markets. Shenzhen-based UBS-SDIC Fund Management in August 2015 launched the first Chinese mutual fund product to invest in local commodities in the form of a ShFE silver futures tracker.

2016-04-26,https://www.reuters.com,"China imposes fresh curbs on commodities as iron ore, steel slide","BEIJING/MANILA (Reuters) - Chinese commodities exchanges stepped up efforts on Tuesday to curb surging prices that some say have been driven by speculators, raising fears of another derivatives bubble after last year’s stock market collapse. Columns of steel are stacked inside the China Steel production factory in Kaohsiung May 18, 2010.   REUTERS/Pichi Chuang/File Photo        Transaction fees for iron ore futures were hiked for a second time in as many days, after the original increase led to a sharp drop in iron ore and steel futures in China that helped cool a week-long surge in local commodities markets. Base metals futures also fell on Tuesday, while other commodities, including coking coal and cotton, surrendered most of their early gains to end nearly flat. China’s top commodity exchanges in Dalian, Shanghai and Zhengzhou increased trading margins and fees in response to last week’s spike in prices and volumes, which some analysts said were not matched by fundamentals for the underlying commodities. The Dalian Commodities Exchange in northeast China said it would raise transaction fees for iron ore and polypropylene futures contracts twice in two days this week. The exchange said on Tuesday it would also hike transaction fees for coke and coking coal futures contracts starting from April 27. The most traded September iron ore contract on the Dalian exchange closed down 6 percent at its exchange-set floor of 450.50 yuan ($69.35) a ton. It hit 502 yuan on Monday, its strongest since August 2014. Analysts say the spike was largely due to speculators betting that a rise in infrastructure spending in China would lift raw material prices, which have been battered for years by a broad-based glut. But analysts warned that the rise could flip into an equally precipitous fall. “The speculation-driven futures rallies are not sustainable, and consolidation may have some spillover effects on the spot market,” Argonaut Securities’ Helen Lau said in a note. News that China’s top steel making province would ban the reopening of steel mills previously ordered to shut down also weighed on sentiment for commodities used in steel making, which include iron ore, coking coal and coke. SHORTAGE OF SOME MATERIALS On the Shanghai Futures Exchange, rebar - reinforced steel used in construction - fell 3.8 percent to close at 2,554 yuan a ton. Rebar reached a 19-month high of 2,787 yuan on April 21, when its turnover was worth nearly 50 percent more than the total value of trade on the Shanghai stock exchange. The exchange said late on Tuesday that it would reduce night-time trading hours on rebar <0#SRB:>, hot-rolled coil <0#SHHC:> and bitumen <0#SBU:> futures contracts, which are among the most heavily traded on the exchange. Night trading hours for all three contracts will be from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m., compared with 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. previously, beginning on May 3. Open interest in iron and rebar has fallen sharply, suggesting some trades are being executed by investors holding short positions that are getting squeezed. Coking coal on Dalian closed nearly flat at 797.50 yuan a ton after hitting a contract-high of 837.50 yuan earlier. Coke trimmed gains to 0.4 percent after rising as much as 4 percent. The two had soared by their 6 percent limit on Monday. Cotton on Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange also closed little changed after spiking as much as 3.6 percent. The exchange said on Tuesday it would hike transaction fees for cotton futures to 6 yuan ($0.92) per lot from 4.3 yuan, starting from Wednesday. It will also raise the margin and widen the trading limit on the petrochemical PTA futures contract from April 27, the exchange added. Jin Tao, analyst with Guotai Jun’an Futures in Shanghai, said there was a “severe shortage” of coking coal and coke following shutdowns of mines and plants in China last year as steel mills step up production. That has fueled a big spike in spot prices of the two raw materials, particularly this month, said Jin. “Whether the rally can be sustained will depend on whether the government will keep reining in the sector.

That was equivalent to around a third of China’s steel production last year, not just of construction-destined rebar but of every imaginable type of steel product.  And if that sounds like a lot of steel, consider the fact that on March 10 this year trading volumes on the Dalian Exchange iron ore contract exceeded one billion tonnes, more than the combined annual output of Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Brazil’s Vale.  OK. So there’s an element of double-counting at work here since Chinese exchanges tend to include both sides of a trade in their volume figures.  But there’s no disguising the surge in speculative interest that has been sweeping across the spectrum of Chinese commodity contracts, from iron ore to corn to polypropylene.  The flood of money has propelled prices of commodities such as iron ore and steel rebar sharply higher.  Now, however, the authorities have moved to tame the animal spirits firing up Chinese markets with a series of measures such as raising margin requirements, hiking transaction fees and widening daily limits.  They seem to have done the immediate trick with volumes and prices losing some of their froth this week.  But there is a sense that Chinese investors, having once tasted the profitable elixir of trading commodities, are not going to be beaten back for long.  We may be witnessing the start of a whole new chapter in the long-running, stormy story of speculators versus real-world commodity supply chains.

But in China speculative interest has been building for a while in markets that in the West have largely been shunned by the man in the street.  In January last year London copper slumped 11 percent in the space of two days after a concerted bear attack by Chinese funds on the ShFE contract.  It was the first time the London Metal Exchange, where activity is almost exclusively conducted by big industrial and financial players, found itself at the mercy of another market-place.  And those Chinese bears returned to attack copper on the short side in both July and November.  Western traders woke up to the existence of powerful Chinese hedge funds such as the exotically-named Shanghai Chaos.  And in November it wasn’t just copper that got hit. There were crowd selling surges in metals such as aluminum and lead, both of which had largely traded below the radar of most local investors.  The key change appears to have been the Chinese authorities’ clamp down on stocks trading last year in reaction to excessive volatility.  Chinese retail investors simply switched their focus to the commodities sector, laying the foundations for this year’s remarkable explosion in trading activity.  The measures taken to cool overheating markets reveal much about this new type of investor, one who trades on margin (now hiked across the board) and one who is in and out in the space of a day (no more commission discounts for Dalian iron ore day-traders).  REAL-WORLD CONSEQUENCES One of the reasons why the Chinese authorities are moving to try and tame run-away markets is because excessive speculation in commodities can quickly feed through into real-world consequences.  The bear attacks on industrial metals last November caused massive consternation among China’s own producers, who appealed for government help in the face of “malicious short-selling”.  There was frantic talk of concerted production cutbacks, emergency stock-piling and direct government assistance. With hindsight much of it amounted to price-signaling, a warning to short-sellers to back off, although in copper there was concrete government action in the form of purchases from the State Reserves Bureau.  This time around with investment surging on the long side, the real-world impact has been even more far-reaching.  There’s no doubt that Chinese players understood early the likely effects on the entire ferrous supply chain of renewed government stimulus in the form of credit expansion and infrastructure build. Prices of physical commodities were always going to react higher but the scale and the speed of the price rallies have been unprecedented.      The price of physical iron ore jumped by 20 percent on March 4 and it did so because of the rocketing price on the Dalian exchange, which in turn was being fed by the rocketing price of steel futures in Shanghai.  Steel rebar prices have lost some of their froth but are still trading at levels last seen in January 2015.  The result has been the wholesale reactivation of idled steel production in China. National output jumped from an annualized 736 million tonnes in February to 832 million tonnes in March. Not only does this run counter to Beijing’s own policy about phasing out surplus steel capacity but it is intensely problematic in the context of escalating criticism and accumulating trade sanctions from other steel-producing countries.  But such, apparently, is the cumulative power of the Dalian and Shanghai day-traders.  JUST THE BEGINNING?  It’s ironic that Chinese investors have just found the commodities space when Western investors have lost much of their previous appetite.  Western retail investors never really embraced the host of new products launched at the turn of the decade, preferring to stick with tried and trusted vehicles such as gold exchange-traded funds.  Wholesale investors, meanwhile, became disillusioned both with the theoretical arguments of commodities as portfolio stabilizers and with the more prosaic collapse in commodity prices from their early-decade peaks.  Barclays Capital estimates that assets under management in the commodities sector ended last year at around $160 billion, the lowest level since 2007.  The investment baton, as it were, has been passed to the Chinese investor, who has easier and cheaper access to commodity markets and cares less whether it’s corn or copper as long as it’s moving in the right direction.

2016-04-27,https://www.reuters.com,Chemical companies see rosier results on low crude prices,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Expectations for chemical company earnings have been boosted by a combination of lower crude oil costs during the commodity’s slump along with strong demand for plastics that are used to make everything from shampoo bottles to grocery bags. A worker picks up a plastic bottle as she separates them at a recycling depot in Beijing May 23, 2013. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon The worst oil rout in a generation has cut production costs for plastics that require oil-derived components. The price of plastics followed oil’s rapid climb from 2009 to mid-2014, but on the way back down, plastic prices have not fully followed crude, keeping margins robust for petrochemical companies. Analysts say that should help chemical names when they report results in the coming days. Last week, LyondellBasell Industries beat consensus estimates, and estimates for Westlake Chemical Corp and, to a lesser extent, the more diversified Dow Chemical Corp, have been lifted. Dow reports on Thursday and Westlake posts results on Tuesday. “Lower oil prices led to more demand in the markets and for the person who’s making plastics, their costs went down but their demand went up and they made money,” said Joel Morales, director of polyolephins Americas for IHS. “It’s a perfect world on the petrochemical side.” Dow is expected to report earnings of 83 cents a share on Thursday, and in the last 30 days, six estimates have been raised by an average of 3.7 percent. In 2015, the company reported a pre-tax profit margin of 20.4 percent, its strongest since 1989. Westlake is expected to report earnings of 92 cents a share. In the last 30 days, estimates have seen an average increase of 6 percent. The company’s pre-tax margin was 21.6 percent in 2015, though that was down slightly from the previous two years. Even when the price of certain plastics declined slightly, the decline was partially self-correcting because corporations no longer needed to recycle waste plastic for economic reasons and demand for new plastics rose even more. Globally, the spot prices of certain plastics components like polyethylene and polypropylene are often influenced by pricing of an oil derivative called naphtha. As a result, they are strongly correlated to crude prices, according to Platts analysts. But while U.S. markets generally follow trends set by pricing in Asia, there is often a cost advantage for chemical companies because they are able to use natural gas liquids as feedstocks. As a result, domestic contract pricing for one particular resin, known as HDPE, was down only 26 percent from June 2014, while crude declined more than 65 percent during the same timeframe. “We do see periods of an increased premium for resins over crude oil during the past two years, but primarily in the U.S. domestic market,” said Jim Foster, Platts’ director of analysis for petrochemicals.     In addition, supply this year was particularly short in the United States as planned maintenance at petrochemical plants reduced the supply of certain plastics. While seasonal maintenance is the norm, this year’s work schedule was heavier than usual, according to Charles Neivert, managing director at Cowen in New York. Speaking to analysts on Friday, LyondellBasell CFO Thomas Aebischer said he expects the conditions to persist due to heavy maintenance schedules in both the United States and Asia.

2016-05-12,https://www.reuters.com,Morgan Stanley's commodities head swaps swagger for small and smart,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nancy King, global head of commodities trading at Morgan Stanley, has spent the last few years remodeling what used to be one of the most profitable units on Wall Street, by downsizing and focusing on smaller, smart trades for customers instead of the big, risky bets it used to make on its own account.  Nancy King of Morgan Stanley is shown in this undated photo provided by Morgan Stanley in New York, December 2, 2016.   Courtesy of Larry Lettera/ Wagner Photos/Morgan Stanley/Handout via REUTERS The shift in strategy, which has cut the size of Morgan Stanley’s commodities business by roughly two thirds, was largely forced on the bank by post-financial crisis regulations that banned banks from using their own money on potentially risky speculation, and increased capital requirements. The bank is “sticking their toe back into the market,” said Robert Pease, senior counsel at law firm Bracewell and a former  commodity and energy market regulator. Morgan Stanley’s former crown jewel - built up from the 1990s into a swaggering unit specializing in big bets - has been hemmed in by regulations that have eaten into profits.  Long-dated derivatives pegged to energy prices that once delivered fat margins now fall under onerous capital requirements.  The Federal Reserve no longer wants banks transporting natural gas or stockpiling sheets of aluminum. And the Volcker Rule, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act designed to prevent another crisis, prohibits lenders from proprietary trading, precluding speculative bets on oil and other volatile commodities. As a result, Morgan Stanley sold big chunks of the business that ran afoul of such rules, losing roughly two-thirds of commodities staff in the process. Its exposure to physical commodities has dropped to $179 million, down from $9.7 billion in 2011. Before the financial crisis, the business was one of Morgan Stanley’s most lucrative operations, generating annual revenue of as much as $3 billion with about 400 employees. It now produces around $1 billion in revenue with 150 employees. Commodities trading is no longer a unit unto itself. King and her business now report to Sam Kellie-Smith, who heads fixed-income trading. Previously, the business answered to the head of the larger institutional division that included trading and investment banking. LEARNING CURVE King, a 30-year veteran of Morgan Stanley who started in 1986 as an oil trader, was named the sole global head of commodities in June after global co-head Peter Sherk resigned.  She declined to speak publicly to Reuters about her plans.  With the backing of Kellie-Smith, King is urging staff across the bank to generate more commodities revenue from customers - as opposed to making its own bets - according to people familiar with the strategy.  Earlier this year, the commodities group moved from its suburban campus in Purchase, New York, to Morgan Stanley’s Times Square headquarters in New York City, some 30 miles (48 km) south.  Some commodities traders are now seated near fixed-income staff to improve the flow of information. The metals team sits near the foreign exchange desk, for example, as the two have an overlapping client base. That way, salespeople can offer gold hedges to a client, alongside currencies, to protect against inflation.     Metals traders can now also use risk management tools and technology from the fixed income desk to help with pricing, and make better use of its electronic trading business.  The commodities group is also holding ‘teach-ins’ with colleagues in other parts of the firm, such as investment banking and capital markets, to encourage them to pitch commodity-related products to clients. The aim is to win business from existing Morgan Stanley investor clients who have not typically included commodities in their portfolios, as well as new corporate clients the bank may have dismissed earlier as the opportunity was seen as too small. For example, Morgan Stanley is helping plastics businesses hedge the raw materials used to produce bottles. It is also working with industrial companies to hedge exposure to the cost of polyethylene and polypropylene used in their packaging. While Morgan Stanley has worked with mining companies in the past to help them lock in their future gold or ore production at set prices, it is looking at new ways for these businesses to think about hedging, such as energy usage.  “It’s more small wins and focusing on areas and clients that in the past haven’t been as profitable,” said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston who specializes in commodities. “Businesses that didn’t look as lucrative for banks before are looking better now.” BARRIERS TO SUCCESS However, bankers, traders and industry experts said Morgan Stanley still has challenges. First, the bank faces stiff competition in commodities markets. Not just from rival banks that want to do the same kind of business, like Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Citigroup Inc, but also from non-bank trading firms such as Mercuria Energy Group, Vitol SA, Glencore Plc and Trafigura Group Pte, that do not face the tough regulations lenders do. Second, if President-elect Donald Trump makes good on his campaign promise to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act, and does away with the Volcker rule, proprietary trading may make a comeback, which might force Morgan Stanley into another rethink. In the meantime, if the Federal Reserve becomes more lenient on capital rules and physical commodities, Morgan Stanley may also be at a disadvantage for cutting back on businesses that its chief rival, Goldman, has kept. “If in fact the clock can be turned back, there may be some aspects of what Morgan Stanley used to do that they might want to explore, but cultures have changed,” said Guy Moszkowski, a banking analyst with Autonomous Research. “It’s very hard to rebuild.”  Morgan Stanley had planned to make a big push into inventory financing, where it would lend to buyers of natural resources, using physical inventory as collateral, people familiar with the strategy told Reuters. But that plan is no longer a priority, the people said, after the Federal Reserve’s September move to propose new requirements for banks to hold billions of dollars of extra capital in their commodities business, which would depress returns in inventory financing and other businesses. Bruce Bullock, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University’s Cox School of Business, said Morgan Stanley can still make its reduced and redesigned commodities unit work.  “The bank’s job is to know their clients backwards and forwards and to manage their risks better than the average trading house,” he said. “If banks can maintain this deep view of the business, they’ll win.” Reporting by Olivia Oran in New York; Additional reporting by Jessica Resnick-Ault and Catherine Ngai; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Bill RigbyOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
2016-05-12,https://www.reuters.com,UPDATE 2-Alberta petrochemical projects get C$500 mln royalty credits,"(Adds comments by provincial minister, background on projects and economy) CALGARY, Alberta, Dec 5 (Reuters) - The Canadian oil-producing province of Alberta will offer C$500 million ($377.84 million) in royalty credits to Pembina Pipeline Corp  and Inter Pipeline Ltd for their petrochemical projects, the government said on Monday, as it seeks to diversify its ailing economy. The provincial government said the companies were the approved applicants of its Petrochemicals Diversification Program, which supports construction of facilities that use propane or methane, components of natural gas, as feedstock to produce materials for products including plastics, detergents and textiles. Although petrochemical facilities do not pay royalties, the credits they earn can be traded or sold to oil or natural gas producers, who in turn can use them to reduce royalty payments to the government. Pembina’s project is a joint venture with Kuwait’s Petrochemical Industries Company and has been approved to receive up to C$300 million in royalty credits to build a propylene-polypropylene facility, Minister for Economic Development and Trade Deron Bilous told reporters in the province’s capital of Edmonton. The project by Inter Pipeline, which would process propane into propylene, has been approved to receive up to C$200 million in royalty credits, he said. “Once these two projects are up and running, they will support more than 1,400 direct and indirect fulltime jobs,” Bilous said, adding the facilities will be operational in 2021. There are no plans to extend the program, according to a government statement. Alberta is the largest source of U.S. oil imports and its previously booming economy has been hard hit by the global crude price slump, with companies slashing billions of dollars in capital spending and laying off tens of thousands of workers. This year the left-leaning provincial government unveiled a review of energy royalties that left rates unchanged on existing oil wells and oil sands projects, and avoided adding more cost burdens to an industry already reeling from the lowest crude prices in more than a decade.

2016-05-12,https://www.reuters.com,Morgan Stanley's commodities head swaps swagger for small and smart,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nancy King, global head of commodities trading at Morgan Stanley, has spent the last few years remodeling what used to be one of the most profitable units on Wall Street, by downsizing and focusing on smaller, smart trades for customers instead of the big, risky bets it used to make on its own account.  Nancy King of Morgan Stanley is shown in this undated photo provided by Morgan Stanley in New York, December 2, 2016.   Courtesy of Larry Lettera/ Wagner Photos/Morgan Stanley/Handout via REUTERS The shift in strategy, which has cut the size of Morgan Stanley’s commodities business by roughly two thirds, was largely forced on the bank by post-financial crisis regulations that banned banks from using their own money on potentially risky speculation, and increased capital requirements. The bank is “sticking their toe back into the market,” said Robert Pease, senior counsel at law firm Bracewell and a former  commodity and energy market regulator. Morgan Stanley’s former crown jewel - built up from the 1990s into a swaggering unit specializing in big bets - has been hemmed in by regulations that have eaten into profits.  Long-dated derivatives pegged to energy prices that once delivered fat margins now fall under onerous capital requirements.  The Federal Reserve no longer wants banks transporting natural gas or stockpiling sheets of aluminum. And the Volcker Rule, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act designed to prevent another crisis, prohibits lenders from proprietary trading, precluding speculative bets on oil and other volatile commodities. As a result, Morgan Stanley sold big chunks of the business that ran afoul of such rules, losing roughly two-thirds of commodities staff in the process. Its exposure to physical commodities has dropped to $179 million, down from $9.7 billion in 2011. Before the financial crisis, the business was one of Morgan Stanley’s most lucrative operations, generating annual revenue of as much as $3 billion with about 400 employees. It now produces around $1 billion in revenue with 150 employees. Commodities trading is no longer a unit unto itself. King and her business now report to Sam Kellie-Smith, who heads fixed-income trading. Previously, the business answered to the head of the larger institutional division that included trading and investment banking. LEARNING CURVE King, a 30-year veteran of Morgan Stanley who started in 1986 as an oil trader, was named the sole global head of commodities in June after global co-head Peter Sherk resigned.  She declined to speak publicly to Reuters about her plans.  With the backing of Kellie-Smith, King is urging staff across the bank to generate more commodities revenue from customers - as opposed to making its own bets - according to people familiar with the strategy.  Earlier this year, the commodities group moved from its suburban campus in Purchase, New York, to Morgan Stanley’s Times Square headquarters in New York City, some 30 miles (48 km) south.  Some commodities traders are now seated near fixed-income staff to improve the flow of information. The metals team sits near the foreign exchange desk, for example, as the two have an overlapping client base. That way, salespeople can offer gold hedges to a client, alongside currencies, to protect against inflation.     Metals traders can now also use risk management tools and technology from the fixed income desk to help with pricing, and make better use of its electronic trading business.  The commodities group is also holding ‘teach-ins’ with colleagues in other parts of the firm, such as investment banking and capital markets, to encourage them to pitch commodity-related products to clients. The aim is to win business from existing Morgan Stanley investor clients who have not typically included commodities in their portfolios, as well as new corporate clients the bank may have dismissed earlier as the opportunity was seen as too small. For example, Morgan Stanley is helping plastics businesses hedge the raw materials used to produce bottles. It is also working with industrial companies to hedge exposure to the cost of polyethylene and polypropylene used in their packaging. While Morgan Stanley has worked with mining companies in the past to help them lock in their future gold or ore production at set prices, it is looking at new ways for these businesses to think about hedging, such as energy usage.  “It’s more small wins and focusing on areas and clients that in the past haven’t been as profitable,” said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston who specializes in commodities. “Businesses that didn’t look as lucrative for banks before are looking better now.” BARRIERS TO SUCCESS However, bankers, traders and industry experts said Morgan Stanley still has challenges. First, the bank faces stiff competition in commodities markets. Not just from rival banks that want to do the same kind of business, like Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Citigroup Inc, but also from non-bank trading firms such as Mercuria Energy Group, Vitol SA, Glencore Plc and Trafigura Group Pte, that do not face the tough regulations lenders do.

2016-05-30,https://www.reuters.com,Egypt's Carbon Holdings has first backing for $5 bln petrochemical funding,"DUBAI, May 30 (Reuters) - Egypt’s Carbon Holdings has secured agreement with one of the four export credit agencies expected to provide financing worth between $4 billion and $5 billion for its massive Tahrir petrochemicals project, its chief executive said on Monday. The $7 billion scheme at Ain Sokhna at the southern end of the Suez Canal will be one of the largest petrochemicals projects in Egypt. It is projected to increase by about 50 percent the amount of such products made by the North African country in the first 10 years after becoming operational. The financing was expected to close by the end of 2015 and be provided by five agencies, but talks were put on hold because the Export-Import Bank of the United States (U.S. EXIM) couldn’t lend new cash until its licence was renewed by Congress, according to Carbon Holdings CEO Basil El-Baz. However, the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation has now agreed to direct funding, Baz told Reuters in Dubai without stating for how much the agreement was worth. “We are optimistic that we should be in a position to wrap this up this year,” Baz said of the full finance package. Carbon Holdings expects three other agencies to contribute to the 17-and-a-half-year debt facility, either through direct lending or guarantees for commercial bank loans. They are U.S. EXIM, Sace of Italy and UK Export Finance. The start of Tahrir’s construction has also been delayed from the timetable given last year. Baz said that work is now expected to begin at “the back end of this year” and last for about 48 months. Societe Generale is advising on the Tahrir project, Baz said. Other petrochemical projects with links to the main scheme have progressed much further. A polypropylene plant had been online since September and a $570 million ammonium nitrate facility is expected to be fully operational in July. The chief executive was speaking as the company announced a $25 million investment in Carbon Holdings by the International Finance Corporation. The transaction, aimed at developing Egypt’s petrochemicals industry, could led to larger investments in Carbon Holdings and its projects, including around Tahrir, said Mouayed Makhlouf, IFC director for the Middle East and North Africa.

2016-06-05,https://www.reuters.com,Factbox: China exchanges move to tame wild moves in commodities,"(Reuters) - China’s commodity exchanges in Dalian, Shanghai and Zhengzhou have increased transactions costs and widened trading limits to fight speculative investment seen behind the surprise surge in commodity futures last month that unnerved global investors. The series of measures helped fuel a retreat but the steep drop in prices and volumes may have prompted the Dalian Commodity Exchange on Friday to say it will cut non-intraday fees on futures products such as iron ore and coking coal. Below is the list of actions that the exchanges have taken so far: IRON ORE The Dalian Commodity Exchange has been the most aggressive in imposing measures to curb speculation following surges in prices and volumes for its iron ore, coking coal and coke contracts.     Dalian increased the trading margin for iron ore futures to 8 percent from 7 percent on April 25. It raised the transaction cost to 0.018 percent from 0.009 percent on April 26 and further increased it to 0.03 percent on April 27. From May 10, the exchange said the fee for non-intraday trading will be set at 0.006 percent. COKING COAL AND COKE Dalian raised the transaction fees on coke and coking coal to 0.006 percent from 0.003 percent on April 22. It raised the fees further to 0.018 percent on April 26 and to 0.036 percent on April 27. On April 28, the costs were increased again to 0.072 percent. From May 10, the exchange said the transaction fee for non-intraday trading will be set at 0.006 percent. The exchange also widened the trading limit for both contracts to 7 percent from 6 percent, for moves in either direction, from April 29 and increased the minimum margin to 9 percent from 8 percent. REBAR The Shanghai Futures Exchange raised transaction fees for rebar to 0.01 percent from 0.006 percent on April 25. Transaction fees of hot rolled coil futures were increased to 0.01 percent from 0.004 percent and bitumen to 0.01 percent from 0.008 percent. Starting May 3, the exchange will cut night-time trading hours for rebar, hot-rolled coil and bitumen to 9 p.m.-11 p.m. from 9 p.m.-1 a.m. previously. COTTON The Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange raised the trading limit for cotton to 5 percent from 4 percent in either direction on April 26. It also increased the trading margin to 7 percent from 5 percent. The bourse increased the transaction fee to 6 yuan per lot from 4.30 yuan, starting on April 27.     POLYPROPYLENE The Dalian exchange increased the transaction fee on polypropylene, a plastic material used in toys and packaging, to 0.009 percent from 0.007 effective on April 25. It later raised the fee to 0.018 percent from April 26 and again to 0.024 percent from April 27. From May 10, the exchange said the transaction fee for non-intraday trading will be set at 0.006 percent. PTA The Zhengzhou exchange widened the trading limit for PTA futures contracts to 5 percent from 4 percent and the trading margin to 6 percent from 5 percent starting on April 27. PTA, or purified terephthalic acid, is used in making polyester fiber.  THERMAL COAL The Zhengzhou exchange raised trading margin for thermal coal futures to 6 percent from 5 percent and the trading limit to 5 percent from 4 percent effective on April 26.

2016-08-17,https://www.reuters.com,Flood-hit Bangladesh plans to keep food safe in home silos,"DHAKA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -  With millions of Bangladeshis hit by devastating monsoon floods in the past month, the government and aid agencies are helping them with emergency food and shelter, while working to improve protection against future disasters.    By June 2019, the government will distribute half a million “household food silos” to people in areas prone to storms and flooding, to keep their food stocks safe from water and other threats.  Bangladesh’s Humanitarian Coordination Task Team - made up of government and U.N. experts, aid agencies and donors - estimates that some 3.7 million people in 19 districts have been affected by the recent floods which began in mid-July.  More than 250,000 houses are reported damaged, including nearly 17,000 houses that have been washed away completely and over 65,000 partially lost to riverbank erosion.  Around 110 deaths have been reported due to drowning, most of them minors, according to government health officials.  The water has now started receding but experts expect another bout of flooding this month as rainfall has increased upstream in India and Nepal, whose rivers flow through Bangladesh to the Bay of Bengal.   Of the total number of people affected by the latest floods, around 2 million live in Jamalpur, Kurigram and Gaibandha - Bangladesh’s poorest districts, where around a third of the population falls below the poverty line. These northern areas were also hit by severe flooding in September 2014.  RED CROSS APPEAL Aid workers report that the latest floods are the most devastating of the last two to three decades.      “This flood is the worst in the last 30 years, affected people say,” said Adith Shah Durjoy, disaster operations coordinator for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in Bangladesh. Some poor families also suffered in the floods two years ago, he noted.  “The self-recovery capacity of these people is destroyed by repeated floods,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. An assessment by the humanitarian team said the food security and livelihoods of people in affected areas had been dealt a serious blow by the recent floods.  There are acute food shortages in some areas, as household food stocks have been damaged and food production hampered.  People are eating only one or two meals a day, instead of three, and a lack of fodder for animals, especially cattle, means rural families face losing important assets.  The government is responding to immediate relief needs, alongside local and international aid agencies, Durjoy said.  The Bangladesh Red Crescent Society has so far distributed food to more than 27,000 people, and is using water treatment kits to provide clean drinking water to 15,000.  On Wednesday, the IFRC launched an emergency appeal for $1.7 million to support its Bangladesh arm in reaching 105,000 people with emergency assistance. “The floods have inflicted significant damage and hardship across the country,” said Mozharul Huq, secretary general of the Bangladesh Red Crescent. “Homes have been completely destroyed, (and) there’s a shortage of clean water and lack of toilets. People’s livelihoods have been left in tatters.” Mahbubur Rahman, emergency response and preparedness coordinator for CARE Bangladesh, said humanitarian relief had yet to reach hundreds of thousands of people.  International charity CARE is providing food and basic shelter to more than 2,500 families in Bogra and Kurigram districts, with funding from the British and U.S. governments.  MORE CLIMATE DISASTERS Much of Bangladesh’s land is a low-lying delta plain, meaning many parts of the country regularly go under water.  Monsoon floods often inundate homes and fields, causing crop losses and damaging food stocks.  But natural disasters exacerbated by climate change are happening more often, according to Atiq Rahman, executive director of the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies.  “In the northern districts, agriculture - particularly rice and vegetables - is damaged, alongside losing lives,” he said of the current floods. “Disastrous events are hitting more frequently than before.”  There can also be considerable climate variability across the country, he added. For example, in April the northeastern districts of Sunamganj and Sylhet saw flash floods, while Barind Tract in the northwest was suffering from drought.    PLASTIC POTS Experts say major cyclones and floods are causing fewer deaths than in the past, thanks to alerts and evacuations. But vulnerable households are losing their ability to cope as growing climate stresses push them deeper into poverty.   As part of a government effort to help people manage climate risks, the “household silos” will be given to coastal and river-bank dwellers so they can keep their grain dry when waters rise. The World Bank is providing $8.37 million to procure the silos from local company Madina Polymer Industries Ltd, under the project to modernize food storage.  Made of polypropylene copolymer food-grade plastic, the silos look like earthenware pots, and can protect grain from chemical, thermal and weather effects. They are equipped with a seal that keeps the food inside dry even if the silo remains underwater for a long time during floods. The government will also build eight large silos that can store 535,000 tonnes of grain to respond to needs during natural disasters around the country.

2016-11-11,https://www.reuters.com,Fitch Rates Kangde Xin at 'BB'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) HONG KONG, November 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Long-Term  Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating and senior unsecured rating of 'BB' to  Kangde Xin Composite Material Group Co., Ltd. (KDX). The Outlook is Stable.  Fitch also has assigned Top Wise Excellent Enterprise Co., Ltd.'s proposed US  dollar senior notes a 'BB(EXP)' expected rating. Top Wise Excellent Enterprise  is a fully owned subsidiary of KDX and the proposed notes are unconditionally  and irrevocably guaranteed by KDX. The notes are rated as the same level as  KDX's senior unsecured debt rating as they represent direct, unconditional,  unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company. The final rating on the proposed notes is contingent upon the receipt of  documents conforming to information already received. Beijing-based KDX is a leading manufacturer of lamination film globally. It also  produces optical film used in liquid crystal display (LCD), auto windows, home  appliances and other applications. KEY RATING DRIVERS Low-Cost Base: KDX's cost advantages have helped it to maintain gross profit  margin above 31% since 2012; with margin of 37% in 2015. KDX is completely  self-sufficient in terms of raw materials in its lamination film segment, and  moderately self-sufficient in the optical film segment. KDX has also invested  heavily in importing equipment and developing core technologies, such as  ultra-precision mould processing. In contrast, most of its domestic competitors  need to buy raw materials from overseas suppliers and do not have plants that  are able to produce at as high a standard as those of KDX. Moderate Market Position: KDX operates in fragmented markets and has relatively  small market shares. However, this is mitigated by its focus on mid-to-high end  products and strong relationships with its customers, which result in moderate  bargaining power with its customers. KDX is the world's third-largest producer  of display optical film after LG Chemical and Toray Industries, Inc. It  accounted for about 11% of global output in 2015. KDX is also a leading global  producer of biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) lamination film, which is  used in packaging.  Optical Film to Erode Margin: We expect the company's operating EBITDA margin to  narrow to around 30% in 2016 from 32.7% in 2015. KDX's display film revenue  expanded over past few years to 29% consolidated revenue in 2015, but gross  profit margin for this segment shrank to around 20% in 2015 from above 30%  before 2013. This was mainly due to more supply of display film in the market,  the slowdown in flat panel shipments globally and a decline in prices of LCD TV  panels.  Weak Free Cash Generation: We expect KDX's free cash flow to continue to be  negative in the medium term because of its long trade receivable days, high  capex, and weaker operating EBITDA margin. KDX's trade receivable days has been  very long over past few years, and was above 130 in 2015. This was mainly driven  by the optical film business, where KDX gives customers a credit term of 180  days, which is industry norm, according to the company. In addition, we expect  its 2016 capex to be CNY2.5bn, much higher than CNY215m in 2015, to expand  manufacturing capacity for optical film and add capacity to modules that produce  naked-eye 3D film.  Low Leverage on Equity Funding: We expect KDX to remain in a net cash position,  assuming there are no large debt-funded acquisitions or investments. KDX's very  aggressive capex plans for the next three years (CNY2.5bn per year) would be  funded via secondary equity offerings.

The country’s third-largest oil refiner said in a quarterly earnings statement on Thursday that global oil demand would grow soundly in 2017, although the rate of increase could ease slightly from last year. “Healthy margins are expected as 1.32 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil demand growth will outstrip an incremental net capacity increase of 574,000 bpd,” the company said, referring to the profit margin on refining barrels of crude oil. Inventory gains and a recovery in refining margins helped S-Oil, whose top shareholder is Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE, notch up a 444 billion won ($386 million) profit in the last quarter of 2016, compared with a loss of 42.9 billion won the year before. S-Oil treasurer Shin Kwan-bae said on a call with analysts that the company expected the official selling price (OSP) for Arab Light crude, supplied by Saudi Arabia, to remain steady in Asia from last year. He said that even if Middle Eastern crude supply drops in the wake of a deal by producers to curb output, Saudi Arabia would not want to harm its market share in Asia by increasing OSPs. A company official said S-Oil planned to carry out less scheduled maintenances this year, limiting such work to a condensate fractionation unit (CFU) and a No.2 paraxylene unit. He did not give further details. Industry sources have said S-Oil would shut down its No.1 residue hydro desulphurisation unit (RHDS) and crude oil refining unit in April for about a month. S-Oil also said on Thursday that its 2018 expansion project was on track to complete in the first half of next year. Under the project, the company will build a residual fuel oil upgrading system and an olefin production system that will churn out 405,000 tonnes of polypropylene a year, along with other products.

Gone is the low seat, poor protection and white bath-like design that Clive Sinclair, who made his name as a famed innovator in the computer sector, was ridiculed for when he launched it in 1985 as the future of transport. In its place is a three-wheeled Iris eTrike prototype, with an elevated seat, the look of a modern day cycling crash helmet and made from expanded polypropylene foam, a hardy substance used in model aircraft builds for its ability to absorb impacts. “There’s nothing else like this on the market. In terms of other e-bikes this is much lighter weight, and much safer because it’s like sitting inside a large crash helmet,” Grant Sinclair told Reuters.   Sinclair, 44, showed off the zippy 55 kilogram (121 pounds) one-seater vehicle in a ride over Old Town Bridge from England to Wales, riding ahead of a post van and then through a path in a local park. The Iris has normal bicycle pedals and eight-speed race bike gearing, combined with a 250-watt electric motor with rechargeable battery pack that kicks in automatically once pedaling is detected. Recharging takes one hour. Sinclair said his vehicle, which can reach speeds of upto 30 miles per hour (48 kph) and be ridden for up to 50 miles (80 km) with the motor, had grabbed the attention of three established manufacturers who were keen to mass produce it. He is the third Sinclair to attempt to convince the world about eTrikes, with Clive’s son Crispin failing two years ago with a design called Babel, which was unable to raise the required funds through crowdfunding. Slideshow (6 Images)The original C5 enjoyed millions of investment but managed minimal sales before it was discontinued, but Grant Sinclair is optimistic the world is now ready for e-Trikes.  “I think the C5 would have a much easier time these days because you have cycle paths everywhere,” Sinclair said.

Other regional bourses were mixed in quiet trade. Advanced Petrochemical dropped 2.5 percent after the polypropylene maker posted first-quarter net income of 124 million riyals ($33.1 million), down 12.9 percent from a year ago and below NCB Capital’s prediction of 149 million riyals. Other petrochemical makers were also weak after Brent crude slipped below $51 a barrel overnight to its lowest close this year. Riyadh’s stock index lost 0.6 percent in modest trading volume. The prince said the government would focus on investing in the mining sector, developing the weapons industry, supporting growth of an auto industry and improving the kingdom’s logistics, both sea and air. He also said authorities would announce a programme to address Saudi Arabia’s shortage of private housing in the third quarter of this year. But he did not give a time frame or expected expenditure on those projects. Among companies that could benefit from the government’s industrial investment, Emaar the Economic City edged up 0.3 percent, extending the previous session’s 4.6 percent gain, but Saudi Automotive Services gave back most of Tuesday’s rise and fell 2.9 percent. Saudi Mining Co (Ma’aden) the only listed company directly involved in mining, edged up 0.5 percent. National Metal Manufacturing and Casting rose 0.7 percent. Small ground freight and logistics company Batic Investments and Logistics added 1.4 percent in active trade. Elsewhere, Dubai’s index edged down 0.5 percent as Bahraini investment firm GFH Financial slumped 8.9 percent. The company reported quarterly net income attributable to shareholders of $31.91 million, up from $6.06 million a year earlier, but the stock had already risen sharply over the past week in anticipation of strong earnings. Twenty-two other shares declined in Dubai, including builder Arabtec, which fell 2.4 percent. In Abu Dhabi, the index rose 0.6 percent as the largest listed lender, First Abu Dhabi Bank, climbed 1.4 percent. QATAR’S OOREDOO Qatar’s index lost 0.4 percent to a five-month low as telecommunications operator Ooredoo dropped 2.3 percent. Its Omani unit looks set to face fresh competition after Abu Dhabi’s Etisalat joined Saudi Telecom and Kuwait’s Zain Group in bidding for Oman’s third mobile licence. Kunal Damle, senior institutional sales broker at SICO Bahrain, said all the bidders had a strong cash position and would not need to raise debt to operate in Oman. He believes Saudi Telecom and Zain stand the best chances of winning. “From a consumer’s standpoint, Oman would be better off with the product offering from STC’s VIVA brand. However, the decision may hinge on the fact that Kuwait is a big investor in the sultanate,” Damle added. At present, Oman Telecommunication and Ooredoo Oman both have equal market shares of around 41 percent. Omantel was flat on Wednesday while Ooredoo Oman lost 0.4 percent. The Egyptian index added 0.6 percent in thin trade with declining stocks in the broad market outnumbering gainers by 93 to 71. SAUDI ARABIA * The index fell 0.6 percent to 6,968 points.

2017-04-08,https://www.reuters.com,Indian Oil plans $2.4 bln expansion of Gujarat refinery,"* Expansion will increase capacity to 360,000 bpd by end 2021 * Aimed at meeting rising local demand for fuel * Part of broader IOC plan to increase refining capacity By Nidhi Verma and Neha Dasgupta NEW DELHI, Aug 4 (Reuters) - India’s top refiner Indian Oil Corp will spend $2.4 billion to increase capacity at its refinery in western India by about a third over the next few years to meet rising local demand for fuel. The plan, announced on Friday, will enable the plant in Gujarat state to process 360,000 barrels per day (bdp) of oil by the end of 2021. It is part of IOC’s vision to increase its refining capacity by about 89 percent to 3 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2030 by building new plants and expanding some existing ones. The 274,000 bpd Koyali refinery, built in 1965, has five crude units and IOC wants to replace four of them with a single 300,000 bpd crude unit. The 150.3 billion rupee ($2.4 billion) expansion will also enable the Gujarat plant to process cheaper, tougher oil grades and improve profitability. The secondary units at the plant will be ready by the end of 2022, IOC said in a statement. India has emerged as a bright spot amid soft demand for oil elsewhere in the world, but the South Asian nation’s push to electric vehicles is forcing analysts to revise forecasts for fuel demand in the world’s third biggest oil consumer. The revamped plant will have the flexibility to withstand fluctuations in future demand and supply of fuels and to integrate with downstream petrochemical units, IOC Chairman Sanjiv Singh said. The refiner is also setting up a 420,000 tonnes a year polypropylene unit at the refinery. IOC is bolstering its gas imports and retail business as well, as India seeks to increase cleaner fuel’s share to 15 percent of the country’s energy use in the next few years from 8 percent currently. The company’s board has approved a plan to buy up to a 50 percent stake in the 5 million tonne a year Mundra LNG terminal on India’s west coast. The terminal, being set up by a joint venture between Gujarat State Petroleum and Adani Enterprises Ltd at a cost of about 50 billion rupees, will start operations in the first quarter of next year. IOC currently imports liquefied natural gas at Petronet LNG’s west coast terminal for supplying to industries. It is also building a 5 million tonne a year LNG terminal at Ennore on the east coast and hopes to commission the facility in 2018-19.

At a meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee, the central bank hiked its overnight deposit rate to 16.75 percent from 14.75 percent and its overnight lending rate to 17.75 from 15.75 percent. This was the bank’s first increase in rates since an aggressive hike of 300 basis points in November. While the rationale behind the interest rate hike was to help combat Cairo’s hyperinflation and comes at the recommendation of the International Monetary Fund, equity markets were not prepared for such a move and companies will start to brace for an era of higher cost of borrowing. “While we expect a market-wide correction as an immediate reaction to the increased opportunity cost of capital, the impact should be felt more on companies that are excessively leveraged,” said Cairo’s Naeem Brokerage. Analysts, however, tempered the outlook saying that the correction should be “temporary” because the bulk of the market risk premium has “already been priced into the risk free rate”. Nevertheless investors dashed to exit positions with real estate related shares being the hardest hit; Palm Hills Development Company lost 4.4 percent. Elsewhere, the Saudi Arabian index was down 0.2 percent on some profit taking from the previous session’s 0.8 percent gains. Declining shares outnumbered advancing ones 89 to 44 with material makers and other industrial companies being the main drag on the index. The polypropylene producer National Industrialization Company was down 1.0 percent. In the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi’s index was flat while Dubai’s index was up 0.5 percent on the back of strong gains in commodities shipper Gulf Navigation ; its shares jumped 4.9 percent. Qatar’s index was up 0.8 percent with main support from blue chip shares that are constituents of the MSCI emerging market index. Islamic lender Masraf Al Rayan was up 1.6 percent.

Braskem expects to complete construction of the unit based in La Porte, Texas, in the first quarter of 2020. The plant will have capacity to produce 450,000 tonnes of polypropylene per year, Braskem said in a statement. Braskem shares are down nearly 7 percent in 2017 despite hopes of stronger operating profits as traders have eyed corruption investigations circling the petrochemical firm. Braskem agreed to fines in Brazil and the United States to settle charges that it schemed with one of its main shareholders, Odebrecht SA, to bribe politicians and executives in Brazil.

A technician molds a prosthetic limb made out of polypropylene at the Physical Rehabilitation and Reference Center in Juba, South Sudan, June 28, 2017. Thomson Reuters/Stefanie Glinski\nAnd he was one of the lucky ones.  For weeks later, Solomon was back on two feet with the aid of an artificial leg, fitted at a hectic hospital cum limb-making factory in the South Sudanese capital of Juba. The hospital is in horribly high demand in a country born of war that remains littered with mines and explosive devices, with civil war still raging all around.  Most of South Sudan’s approximately 60,000 amputees have suffered war-related injuries, be it gunshot or landmine wounds. As civil war devastates the world’s youngest country - it celebrates its sixth anniversary next month - it has become increasingly difficult for amputees to gain good treatment.  SECOND CHANCE Solomon came to his first artificial limb after an open fracture turned into a life-threatening infection, which forced doctors to amputate.  When he woke from surgery in a remote hospital in South Sudan’s Bentiu, he was far away from the capital with little chance of rehabilitation or help adjusting to his new life.  “I was put on a flight to Juba, where I am receiving a new, artificial leg,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from his current home at the Physical Rehabilitation Reference Centre. It is the country’s biggest hospital for prosthetic orthotic treatment, treating about 30 patients a day. “Amputations have gone up since the beginning of the civil war in 2013, but even with increased need, access to some areas is impossible due to active fighting and many people who have lost limbs might never be able to get out and receive help,” said Emmanuel Lobari, who as head of technicians oversees the production of all the prosthetic limbs. Both hospital and factory, the center produces an average of 50 prostheses each month – all hand-made and custom fit. DURABLE, AFFORDABLE “We use polypropylene to make the limbs, a material that has proved to be both durable and affordable,” said physiotherapist Daniel Odhiambo.  A Kenyan, he is one of a handful of expatriate staff at the hospital, employed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  “The prostheses last for an average of two years and it’s usually the foot, made out of a softer material, that wears out the fastest. The leg itself can last up to ten years.”  Making a limb – from melting the plastic-like polypropylene to shaping it into a leg – is a quick process in the hospital’s small, modern factory and can all be done within a day.  “It’s the fitting and the patient’s adaption that take up to ten days,” said Lobari.  Lobari is South Sudanese, like most of the hospital’s 30 staff, all of whom received Red Cross training. The organization first started treating amputations in 1979 during Ethiopia’s civil war, and developed the polypropylene technology that has since spread across all conflict zones.  Odhiambo has worked in many places, including Afghanistan, Yemen and Iraq. He recently took up his second mission in Juba. “Here in South Sudan, I mainly see war wounds and they are very different from civilian wounds,” he explained.  Nearly 250,000 mines and explosive devices were found and destroyed in South Sudan in 2017 alone, according to the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS). South Sudan slipped into civil war in 2013, just two years after becoming independent from Khartoum, and some 4 million people – one third of the population – have fled to neighboring countries in its wake. For those left behind, risk is part of daily life. The worst case Odhiambo has seen is an 18-year-old boy, who was brought to the clinic with both legs blown off by a landmine, pieces of muscle hanging out of the wound and shrapnel fragments stuck deep in his flesh. “He was in consistent pain and it took months to build the right prosthesis, but I stayed with him through the whole process. I told him not to give up. He had his whole life ahead of him still.”  A RESILIENT NATION Simon has been coming to the hospital for several months and can still vividly recall the day he was attacked, when several bullets were shot through his leg.  “I thought I was going to die, but my family took me to a small hospital where my leg was amputated,” he said.  Simon is from the north of the country then moved to Juba to get better care. Three in four patients at the center are male. The women and children at the hospital underwent amputations after suffering a range of traumas, such as war injuries, crocodile bites, road accidents or infections.

REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File Photo The project, known as COTC, the first major scheme to bring the two giants together, is expected to process Arabian Light and Extra Light crude oil, one of the sources told Reuters. Several plants are expected to be built including a 400,000-barrels-per-day integrated crude distillation and vacuum unit, a distillate hydrotreater, a vacuum gas oil hydrocracker, a residual fluid catalytic cracking unit, a mixed feed cracker, as well as polyethylene, polypropylene, butadiene and aromatics recovery units. Aramco and SABIC are still considering where to locate the chemicals site; at Yanbu, near a power plant; or in Jubail, close to Sadara, which is an Aramco joint venture with U.S. company Dow Chemical. The closing date for bids for pre-front end engineering and design work (pre-FEED) and FEED for the COTC is Sept. 25, one of the sources said, adding that the plant is expected to be commissioned by the end of 2024. Another source said pre-FEED is expected to be completed by late 2018, with FEED to be finalised by late 2019. Aramco and SABIC are expected to launch bidding for construction by mid-2020. SABIC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Aramco said it “declines to comment on rumor or speculation”.  Aramco’s chief executive has said it was a priority for the company to convert crude oil to chemicals as the state oil producer aims to diversify operations in the run-up to an initial public offering of shares next year. Downstream, which covers refining and chemicals, will help Aramco boost value from hydrocarbons by securing revenue streams and become less vulnerable to oil price swings. LESS GAS Analysts say the project will help reduce natural gas usage in petrochemicals at a time when the kingdom is trying to use more gas to generate power, rather than burning crude oil, as it seeks to diversify its energy mix. “What is new and different is that the prices of crude and gasoline/diesel have come down more than petrochemicals. This makes the incentive to produce petrochemicals greater than to make gasoline and diesel,” Mark Routt, chief economist for the  Americas at KBC Advanced Technologies, said. “It certainly could usher in a new ‘wave’ of investments in producing those petrochemicals,” he said. The project is strategic for Saudi Arabia, which plans to expand further into the petrochemical chain to export more end products and grow beyond oil. It is also crucial for Saudi Arabia’s economic reform plan and could create as many as 100,000 jobs.

2017-08-25,https://www.reuters.com,Egypt's Carbon Holdings aims to start building Tahrir petrochemicals project by June,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt’s Carbon Holdings aims to finalize funding and start building its massive Tahrir petrochemicals project by June, producing raw materials desperately needed to boost the country’s industrial sector, its chief executive told Reuters. The $10.6 billion scheme in the Suez Canal Economic Zone will be the largest petrochemicals project in Egypt. Carbon Holdings CEO Basil El-Baz sees the project helping to double Egypt’s exports within one year of coming online after its five-year construction. Economic growth for import-dependent Egypt has slowed since a 2011 uprising drove tourists and foreign investors away, but recent reforms tied to a $12 billion International Monetary Fund loan are hoped to put the country back on the right track.     “Why haven’t all these foreign multinationals that keep making visits to Egypt every month started manufacturing? ... What it comes down to is that there are no raw materials,” El-Baz said in a Reuters interview late on Wednesday. Carbon Holdings already has two facilities in production phase, a polypropylene plant and a mining grade ammonium nitrate plant. “We’re going to be looking to list Carbon Holdings at some point,” El-Baz said, but did not specify a date for the listing. Tahrir petrochemicals will have to export all its products  in the first year but as production increases, El-Baz said, domestic manufacturers will be encouraged to expand and foreign ones will consider setting up next to the Suez Canal. The government says the 460-square km economic zone around the canal will be used to develop an international industrial and logistics hub to attract foreign investment. Tahrir petrochemicals, which is being funded by credit agencies in the United States, Britain and Germany, is Egypt’s first naphtha cracker and will produce different types of petrochemicals used to make various consumer and industrial goods. Stepping up exports and reducing imports are one of Egypt’s key goals to reduce the gaping trade deficit and put less pressure on foreign currency dried up by the 2011 uprising. The project, which plans to export to Europe, Africa and Asia, will provide at least 50,000 jobs, El-Baz said. Unemployment in Egypt is close to 12 percent.  “We’re also going to spend about $1.5-2 billion in Egypt, between cement and rebar, the bits and pieces that are made here in Egypt, so that in itself is going to be stimulating the local economy,” El-Baz said.

2017-09-07,https://www.reuters.com,"MIDEAST STOCKS-Slump in oil may weigh on Gulf, surprise rate hike may hurt Egypt","DUBAI, July 9 (Reuters) - A sharp decline in crude oil prices is likely to drag on Gulf stock markets on Sunday, while a surprise interest rate hike may weigh on shares in Egypt. International benchmark Brent crude settled down 2.9 percent at $46.71 a barrel on Friday, after falling to $46.28 earlier that day, its lowest in more than a week. Shares of large-cap polypropylene maker Advanced Petrochemical - the first Saudi company to report second-quarter earnings - may outperform its peers after it posted a better-than-expected net income of 194 million riyals. Analysts at Riyadh-based NCB Capital had expected the firm to report a net income of 133 million riyals ($35.47 million). “We believe higher-than-expected gross margin led to the variance ... which is due to higher operational efficiency following the shutdown in Q1 2017,” said NCB Capital, referring to an eight-day maintenance shutdown at one of its facilities. Advanced Petrochemical’s revenue rose 10.5 percent to 604 million riyals from the year-ago period. At a meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee, the Egyptian central bank raised the overnight deposit rate to 18.75 percent from 16.75 percent and its overnight lending rate to 19.75 from 17.75 percent, after hiking them by 200 points each at the last policy-setting meeting in May. Nine out of 10 economists polled by Reuters on Monday predicted the bank would leave its key interest rates unchanged. “As the news was very unexpected, retail investors are likely to cash out and put their money in time deposits, where they are now getting higher returns on their money,” said a Cairo-based broker. Shares of Arabia Cotton Ginning may get a boost after an Agriculture Ministry spokesman on Saturday said Egypt aimed to double production of cotton and to increase the price of the long staple cotton to more than 3,000 Egyptian pounds ($168.07) per qintar (160 kg), which will all be exported.

While the $879 million flotation by the integrated petrochemical producer was still the largest in Malaysia in five years, its lackluster debut may cast a shadow on the other listings lined up for the year. Lotte Chemical Titan, part of the South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group, fell 1.8 percent to end at 6.38 ringgit on its first day of trade, giving it a market value of 14.7 billion ringgit ($3.4 billion). The company last week had to cut the size of its offering after its books were undersubscribed and its shares later priced at the bottom of their indicative price range of 6.50-8.00 ringgit per share. “The lackluster performance of the stock is from the revision of the final retail price ... creating a negative perception that the stock’s growth was fully priced in previously,” said Mabel Tan, a Public Investment Bank analyst. Tan said Lotte Chemical Titan’s valuation was now attractive as it was cheaper than its peers. It is trading at around 10 times its forward price-to-earnings ratio, compared to its regional peers’ average of 12.2, she added. “The proceeds raised from our IPO will be used to drive our expansion plan in the ASEAN region to further improve operations and capacity,” said Lotte Chemical Titan CEO Lee Dong Woo said. The funds would be used to construct a polypropylene plant in the southern Malaysian state of Johor, develop an integrated petrochemical facility in Indonesia and upgrade the company’s existing naphtha cracker, he added. In contrast to Lotte Chemical Titan’s weak debut, rival Petronas Chemicals (PCGB.KL), with a market value of about 55 billion ringgit, rose 1.5 percent on Tuesday.

2017-11-26,https://www.reuters.com,"Saudi Aramco, SABIC plan to build $20 bln oil-to-chemicals complex","DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - State oil giant Saudi Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] and petrochemical producer Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) signed a preliminary deal on Sunday to build a $20 billion complex to convert crude oil to chemicals. LFILE PHOTO: ogo of Saudi Aramco is seen at the 20th Middle East Oil & Gas Show and Conference (MOES 2017) in Manama, Bahrain, March 7, 2017. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed The project, which the partners said would be the largest crude-to-chemicals facility in the world and the first in the kingdom, are part of the Saudi government’s effort to diversify the economy beyond exporting crude. Private investment has slowed in the kingdom in the last few years due to low oil prices and government austerity, so Riyadh wants to develop manufacturing industries, including chemicals. After signing the memorandum of understanding, Aramco Chief Executive Amin Nasser told reporters a final decision on whether to go ahead with the project would be made by the end of 2019. Investment costs for the complex, which could start production in 2025, would be shared equally. “The two companies can pool their expertise and, given the large size of the capex, partnering hedges their risk,” said Michael Arne, head of emerging technologies research at IHS Markit. Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, has been developing its downstream business as the government prepares to sell up to 5 percent of its shares next year in an initial public offering (IPO). The CEOs of both firms said they were considering locating the complex at the Red Sea port city and industrial center of Yanbu. But Nasser said there were also other options, with factors such as proximity to markets guiding a decision. Yousef al-Benyan, SABIC’s CEO said the two companies would examine the best technology to use, after they had been working on different technologies to convert crude to chemicals before deciding to team up. Benyan said the project could involve two or three crackers, which are used to break heavy hydrocarbons into petrochemicals. The use of so-called flexi-crackers would enable the firms to break down a range of feeds - oil, gas or naphtha. The complex would process crude at international prices to make polyethylene, polypropylene, xylene, benzene and other products, Nasser said. The Saudi project would process about 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Arabian light crude oil to make about 9 million tonnes of chemicals and base oils a year, plus 200,000 bpd of diesel for domestic use. The new complex would create an estimated 30,000 jobs directly and indirectly, adding 1.5 percent to Saudi Arabia’s gross domestic product by 2030, the companies said. The venture would help SABIC expand operations in the kingdom and give it more feedstock options, Benyan said. SABIC has been diversifying its feed base. In China, it plans to make chemicals from coal. In the United States, it wants to build a plant with Exxon Mobil that uses shale gas.

Suez and LyondellBasell will each take 50 percent in Quality Circular Polymer (QCP), a plastics recycling firm based near Maastricht, the Netherlands, which before was held 45 percent by Suez, 20 percent by QCP managers and 35 percent by financial investors. Suez declined to give financial details. QCP’s Sittard-Geleen facility converts consumer waste into 25,000 tons of polypropylene (PP) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) per year and aims to boost that to 35,000 tons in 2018, and 50,000 tons before 2020. LyondellBasell will market the plastics while Suez will feed the plant with plastic waste. Europe produces almost 50 million tons of plastic waste per year, of which only about seven precent is made from recycled polymer, the rest from fossil fuels, Suez said. In nine facilities, Suez turns 400,000 tons of plastic waste into 150,000 tons of new plastic per year. It aims to process 600,000 tonnes by 2020.

Inter Pipeline revealed plans for a petrochemicals plant late last year, and Chief Executive Christian Bayle said on Monday he expects the facility to provide attractive profit margins given strong polypropylene prices in North America. Alberta’s government is seeking to diversify the economy away from oil extraction, and Inter Pipeline’s decision to go ahead with the project is a welcome boost to the country’s largest oil-producing province, which has been struggling with more than three years of low crude prices and a lack of progress in getting new oil export pipelines built. Foreign oil companies have sold off around $23 billion in Canadian assets this year alone. The project is the single largest capital investment in Inter Pipeline’s history and will be funded by a combination of debt and equity financing. The integrated propane dehydrogenation and polypropylene plant, known as the Heartland Petrochemical Complex, will be built in Strathcona County and is the first of its kind in Canada. “Driven by attractive feedstock and utility costs, the Heartland Complex is expected to be one of the lowest cost polypropylene producers in North America,” Bayle said. The facility will convert 22,000 barrels per day of propane, which is plentiful in Alberta because of abundant natural gas production, into 525,000 tonnes per year of polypropylene, a type of plastic.     The project will receive C$200 million of royalty credits from the government’s Petrochemical Diversification Program, launched last year to encourage companies to invest in new facilities. It is one of two that received such credits. The other, by Pembina Pipeline Corp (PPL.TO) and Kuwait Petroleum Corp  (IPO-KUWP.KW), has yet to receive a final investment decision. “We’re excited to see this new investment that will create thousands of good-paying, value-added jobs and help diversify Alberta’s economy,” said Margaret McCuaig-Boyd, Alberta’s minister of energy.

The company, owned by the government of Oman, has not appointed banks yet for the possible financing and talks are still at an early stage, said the sources. ORPIC, which operates four industrial plants at two locations in Muscat and Sohar, has borrowed extensively in the past through project financing and bank debt, but the potential bond sale would be its first deal in the international debt capital markets. The company did not respond to a request for comment. It raised a $2.8 billion loan in 2014 with a consortium of banks to fund various projects, including the expansion of its refinery in Sohar. In early 2016 it secured $3.8 billion in project financing for its Liwa Plastics Industries Complex, a project with a total value of $6.5 billion. ORPIC has been in talks with a number of banks over the past few months to discuss its funding options, which one source said could also include new loans. In addition to two crude oil refineries, ORPIC operates aromatics and polypropylene production plants.

Kasitomu usually stores his grain, vegetables and other harvested food in traditional woven granaries - designed to keep cattle and goats out - or in hessian sacks, or tucked among leaves. But his harvest is frequently attacked by weevils, termites and fungi, he said. That costs him cash, food and seeds he could plant the next season. “We have suffered losses, especially from hybrid (crops) that are not that strong to withstand pests,” the farmer said in an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Pesticides aren’t a solution either, he said, because they are both expensive and cause ecological problems on the farm. But a bit of cheap technology could help, in the form of manufactured storage bags, which more farmers in Malawi are beginning to use. The Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bag is being promoted in seven districts in Malawi as an alternative to using chemical pesticides on stored grain or simply losing it to pests, said Shelix Munthali, an official with the Feed the Future agricultural diversification program, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The bag has two linings of high-density polyethylene, and an outer layer of woven polypropylene. Together, the layers keep out most oxygen, which prevents insects from surviving and reproducing. Up to 98 percent of all insects can be eliminated from stored grain within a month of depositing it in the bag, cutting losses, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Plos One. Malawi’s Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development has endorsed the bags as a proven technology for cutting losses after harvest. “Before I started using PICS bags, I would lose four out of 10 bags (of grain) to weevils and the fungus aflatoxin,” said Trecia Kangala, a farmer from Mchinji district. But “when after seven months I unsealed my first PICS bag, the maize quality was as good as it was the time I sealed the bag. Since chemicals are not used when using PICS bags, I also saved (money),” she added. Aido Chapuma Chakakala, a farmer from Lilongwe, said the bags also protected grain he needed to replant as seed. “This year I decided to plant maize from the PICS bag, (to see) if it could germinate. To my utter surprise, the germination rate was perfect,” he said. “I can boast of a good harvest this year.” The bags are produced in Malawi by Polypack Limited, a Blantyre-based company, and cost 800 kwacha (about $1.10) when purchased in bulk. Feed the Future officials said they are growing in popularity among farmers. In 2014, the year they were first introduced in Malawi, farmers used 70,000 of the bags. Last year that had risen to 350,000 bags, and Feed the Future officials believe orders could reach a half million this year. Munthali said that cutting losses after harvest is crucial, with farmers unable to boost income and food security only by improving fertilizer, seeds and the like. “We realized that we can work with farmers so that they produce a lot. But then if they don’t manage post-harvest losses they are not achieving anything,” Munthali said. Small-scale farmers in Africa often have fewer options to prevent losses after harvest than farmers elsewhere, according to the Plos study. Changing that is important as climate change brings new pressures, experts said. Slideshow (3 Images)“Climate change may induce what were previously minor storage pests to become new (serious) pests, or even enable introduction of new pests,” said George Phiri, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s assistant program representative in Malawi. “PICS can enable farmers to effectively protect their proceeds for seeds, consumption or selling, and prevent storage losses,” he said in an email. Phiri said that protecting crops after harvest was important to ensure farmers had good-quality seed, which he said is critical to bigger harvests and to incomes.

Exxon also agreed to participate in a provincial project to build an LNG terminal in Huizhou and to supply LNG for it, it said. No details about the capacity of the project or timeline were given. China is allowing greater access by global majors and local independents to its massive chemicals market to feed plastics, coatings and adhesives to the fast-growing consumer electronics and automotive sectors. Exxon would be one of only a few international oil majors to invest in LNG infrastructure in China as the country tries to shore up supplies amid a switch to gas-fired boilers by factories and households as part of the government’s battle against smog. The news comes after German chemical giant BASF announced plans in July to invest $10 billion to build China’s first wholly foreign-owned chemicals complex, also in Guangdong. The project includes a steam cracker producing 1 million tonnes a year of ethylene. Details of the ownership structure of Exxon’s chemical plant and LNG investment were not released on Thursday. Still, the deal could be seen as a goodwill gesture by China amid a deepening trade war between the United States and China as the world’s top two economies have traded tit-for-tat punitive tariffs that target $50 billion of each other’s goods. Washington was holding hearings this week on another round of proposed duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that appear likely to take effect in late September or early October.

LNG PUSH  The preliminary deal was signed with the local governments of Guangdong province and Huizhou as well as state power company, Guangdong Yuedian Group, according to the Guangzhou Daily.  While the petrochemical deal was largely expected following a joint study signed late last year, the push on LNG was a surprise and would mark a second investment in China’s gas infrastructure by an international oil company.   “It marks a salient step for Exxon in their pursuit of becoming an LNG portfolio player,” said Saul Kavonic, director for Asia Pacific markets and head of energy research at Credit Suisse in Australia.

2018-07-09,https://www.reuters.com,Pest-proof bags and bins slim Tanzania's 'lean season',"KONDOA, Tanzania (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -  Improved storage techniques have shown they can cut the loss of harvested maize by 10 percent in Tanzania, and help one-third fewer households go hungry in the lean season, Swiss researchers said. As Africa’s population rises and climate change threatens more harvests, simple efforts to protect what is harvested could play a key role in staving off hunger on the continent, they said.  “Improved on-farm storage is particularly important in the ‘lean season’” - the period when one harvest is used up and the next is not yet available, said study coordinator Matthias Huss. That “is often a time of increased food insecurity and hunger,” he said. The study, which was conducted by the University of Zurich, assessed how better crop storage would affect household food security and market prices, said researcher Michael Brander. One year into the study, “the most astonishing finding so far is that the number of people that go hungry has reduced by one-third”, Brander said. The study assessed 1,000 small-scale farmers who were part of a larger project begun in 2013 by Swiss development group Helvetas. That project trained 50,000 farmers in better crop storage techniques using metal bins and hermetically sealed bags.  Selemani Nyange, a 60-year-old farmer, said that prior to the study she would lose three out of the seven bags of her annual maize crop to pests. These days her losses are near zero, said the farmer from Mnenia in central Tanzania.  The bags, also being used in a crop-storage project in Malawi, have two linings of high-density polyethylene and an outer layer of woven polypropylene. These layers keep out most oxygen, preventing insects from surviving and reproducing. Up to 98 percent of insects can be eliminated from stored grain within a month of putting it in the bag, cutting losses, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Plos One.  In Tanzania, bags cost about $2.20 each and metal bins about $100 for 500-kg of storage, researchers said. The improved storage allows farmers to store surpluses longer, and wait for market prices to rise before selling. The bags last two to three years, and the bins at least 15 years, researchers said. BIG LOSSES The Swiss research, which is scheduled to run until 2020, is one of a number of efforts by government agencies and aid groups, among others, to assess post-harvest crop losses and boost rural household incomes. The U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says such losses in sub-Saharan Africa alone total $4 billion a year - enough to feed at least 48 million people. About 20 percent of cereal harvests, 40 to 50 percent of tubers, fruits and vegetables, 27 percent of oilseeds, meat and milk, and 33 percent of fish, are lost, the FAO said. Scientists also warned in August that rising temperatures due to climate change will see larger numbers of hungrier insects attacking crops - leaving less to be harvested.  They said a 2-degree Celsius (3.6-degree Fahrenheit) temperature rise would see insects consume 213 million tons of maize, wheat and rice by 2050 - up from 166 million tons today. And as the invasive fall armyworm pest continues to wreak havoc on crops across Africa - and has now been spotted in India - keeping safe what is harvested will become even more important, experts say. Brander said the biggest losses of harvested crops in Kondoa, prior to the introduction of bags and metal bins, came during storage, with a quarter of the area’s maize crop typically lost. Pests and mould were the key worries. Losses of grains such as cereals and pulses - staples for most of the rural population - was even higher at 30 percent, he said. The losses often meant less food and fewer seeds available for the following year’s planting. Rakesh Munankami, a project team leader at Helvetas, said his organization has worked with 50,000 farmers across Tanzania on crop storage. “Eighty-two percent have adopted the new storage technologies - around 2,700 metal silos and 50,000 hermetic bags have been distributed,” he said. He said the bags and metal bins typically extend food supplies by two months and increase household incomes by about $90. EVICTING THE WEEVILS Philemon Eliabu Ndosi, a senior program officer at the Ministry of Agriculture, said more and more farmers know about the new storage technology. “Currently we have 16 locations which consist of 68 villages where the new technology is widely used,” he told a group of Kondoa farmers in July, adding that the cost savings from these storage options made them popular. The bags and bins reduce the need to mix harvested food with pest-killing chemicals and the cost of paying workers to do that mixing, he said. Amina Hussein, one of the farmers involved in the study, said storage used to be her biggest problem. Every year, much of the maize harvested from her five-acre farm would go to waste, she said. “In a good harvest I got 20-30 bags of maize, but due to storage problems I would lose almost half of it to weevils,” she said. That amounted to 86,000 Tanzanian shillings ($37), which “is a big loss for my family,” she said. The new bags are more robust, as well as more effective, than the plastic bags she used earlier, Hussein said. “(The old) bags would tear very easily and I used to buy (them) almost three times a year. But now, with the hermetic bags, the grains are able to stay fresh for a long period of time,” Hussein said. Reporting by Wesley Langat. Editing by Robert Carmichael and Laurie Goering.

2018-08-06,https://www.reuters.com,Russia's Sibur says new gas chemical complex will cost up to $8 billion,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian petrochemical company Sibur said its plans to build a gas chemical complex in Russia’s Far East will require preliminary investments of up to $8 billion and it is still looking for Asian partners. FILE PHOTO: Dmitry Konov, chief executive of Russian petrochemicals company Sibur, answers a journalist's questions during the Reuters Russia Investment Summit in Moscow September 14, 2011. REUTERS/Denis Sinyakov/File PhotoSibur said a year ago that it had been in talks with a number of Chinese investors about participating in the project to build the complex in Amur. Sibur’s Chief Executive Officer Dmitry Konov told Reuters in a recent interview, that the company, Russia’s largest petrochemicals company, was still talking to investors, without giving details on their progress. “We look at the implementation of the Amur complex as a joint venture, that’s why the investments will be shared among the partners,” Konov said. He estimated preliminary investments in the Amur complex at $7 billion-$8 billion.  The plant will be built to serve Asian markets as part of a broader plan by Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom to supply gas to China. Gazprom will supply the complex with around 2 million tonnes of ethane per year.  The plant will also enable Sibur to diversify into Asia. “The location of the Far Eastern project is not usual for us,” Konov said. “At the moment, our supplies to Asia are not that big. That’s why we see benefits in Asian partners.” Sibur said last year that it had been in talks with China’s Sinopec, which holds a 10 percent stake in Sibur, about investment in the project. A spokeswoman for Sibur declined to comment on Friday on whether Sinopec might invest in the project. Konov said in March that a final decision on investments would be taken next year.  Sibur expects the plant to start operating after 2024, following the launch of Gazprom’s own gas processing plant, also called Amur, which will process the gas before it is exported to China. Sibur’s complex will produce different forms of ethylene from the gas supplied by Gazprom’s plant.  Sibur currently mainly serves clients in the former Soviet Union, although its polymer exports are set to rise with the launch of a $9 billion plant in Tobolsk in Western Siberia by 2020.   Sibur also has been in talks with Saudi Aramco to set up a venture to produce synthetic rubber, a move highlighting growing cooperation between OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and Russia, the biggest non-OPEC oil exporter. Businessman Leonid Mikhelson, the head of and a major shareholder in Russia’s largest gas producer Novatek, owns 48.5 percent of Sibur. His business partner Gennady Timchenko owns 17 percent, while China’s Sinopec and Silk Fund control 10 percent each. Once the Amur and Tobolsk plants are up and running, Sibur will cut exports of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), the feed stock for petrochemicals production. Analysts forecast production in the former Soviet Union of basic polymers, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, will more than double to 9.6 million tonnes per year by 2024, from 4 million tonnes in 2017.

2018-08-06,https://www.reuters.com,Russia's Sibur says new gas chemical complex will cost up to $8 billion,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian petrochemical company Sibur said its plans to build a gas chemical complex in Russia’s Far East will require preliminary investments of up to $8 billion and it is still looking for Asian partners. FILE PHOTO: Dmitry Konov, chief executive of Russian petrochemicals company Sibur, answers a journalist's questions during the Reuters Russia Investment Summit in Moscow September 14, 2011. REUTERS/Denis Sinyakov/File PhotoSibur said a year ago that it had been in talks with a number of Chinese investors about participating in the project to build the complex in Amur. Sibur’s Chief Executive Officer Dmitry Konov told Reuters in a recent interview, that the company, Russia’s largest petrochemicals company, was still talking to investors, without giving details on their progress. “We look at the implementation of the Amur complex as a joint venture, that’s why the investments will be shared among the partners,” Konov said. He estimated preliminary investments in the Amur complex at $7 billion-$8 billion.  The plant will be built to serve Asian markets as part of a broader plan by Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom to supply gas to China. Gazprom will supply the complex with around 2 million tonnes of ethane per year.  The plant will also enable Sibur to diversify into Asia. “The location of the Far Eastern project is not usual for us,” Konov said. “At the moment, our supplies to Asia are not that big. That’s why we see benefits in Asian partners.” Sibur said last year that it had been in talks with China’s Sinopec, which holds a 10 percent stake in Sibur, about investment in the project.

2018-09-05,https://www.reuters.com,Sonatrach to buy ExxonMobil's Augusta oil refinery in Sicily,"LONDON (Reuters) - Algeria’s state energy firm Sonatrach plans to buy ExxonMobil’s (XOM.N) 175,000 barrel-per-day Augusta refinery in Sicily, Italy, the companies said on Wednesday, as the North African oil producer seeks to cut its hefty fuel bills.  Algeria, which needs to meet surging domestic fuel demand, paid $800 million for fuel imports in 2016 but that more than tripled in 2017 to a record $2.5 billion, because of refining problems. Exxon’s Italian subsidiary said the deal included three fuel storage terminals and related pipelines in Augusta, Palermo and Naples, and the transaction was expected to close at the end of 2018. Financial terms were not disclosed.  The deal would be Sonatrach’s first overseas acquisition, reflecting a more flexible and open approach under CEO Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour.  The Augusta refinery is able to process Sahara blend and residual fuel from Algeria’s Skikda plant, “and will be directly integrated into Sonatrach’s refinery system”, the Algerian company said in a statement. “It will also be able to process directly products that are surplus in Algeria in order to re-import products that are in deficit like diesel and petrol,” Sonatrach said. Ould Kaddour said Sicily made sense geographically and because of “possible synergies with Skikda refinery”.      “We are extremely proud to make our first investment in international refining in Italy,” Ould Kaddour said. Ould Kaddour also told French news outlet Les Echos that Sonatrach was about to sign a deal with French oil company Total (TOTF.PA) to build a petrochemical plant in Algeria. “It will be the first unit to produce propylene and polypropylene in Algeria ... most of it will be exported to Europe,” Ould Kaddour told Les Echos. A spokesman for Total declined to comment.  Algeria has struggled to attract foreign investment in recent years and has seen its oil and gas production stagnate.  Since Ould Kaddour took the helm of Sonatrach in March last year, he has been trying to make Sonatrach’s culture more business-friendly and resolve long-standing legal disputes with foreign companies. Sonatrach said in January it had signed a crude for refined products deal with the world’s largest oil trader Vitol to cut its fuel bills, the first deal of its kind in decades. It also said it was looking to invest in a foreign refinery.

2018-09-08,https://www.reuters.com,Factbox: China tariffs on revised list of $16 billion U.S. goods,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Wednesday that it is slapping additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports from fuel and metals to autos and medical equipment, as the world’s largest economies escalated their trade dispute. The tariffs will be activated on Aug. 23, the same day that the United States plans to begin collecting 25 percent extra in tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods. The $16 billion of U.S. products are part of $50 billion of U.S. goods targeted by China. Tariffs on the $34 billion batch of products went into effect on July 6.  The items on the second batch announced on Wednesday differed from those in an earlier draft published in June, which included crude oil. The number of categories of goods subject to tariffs rose to 333 from 114 in the June draft, although the total value is unchanged at around $16 billion due to the removal of crude oil. Following is a list of the items for which the tariffs will be applied in late August.

2018-09-11,https://www.reuters.com,Azeri SOCAR to supply its new Turkish refinery with third-party oil,"BAKU, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Azeri state energy company SOCAR plans to supply its new refinery in Turkey with oil from different producers in Europe, the Black Sea region and the Gulf, the head of SOCAR’s trading arm said in an interview. SOCAR last month launched the $6.3 billion SOCAR Turkey Aegean Refinery (STAR), the first to be built in Turkey for the past 30 years. The facility on Turkey’s Aegean coast will supply feedstock to Turkish petrochemicals firm Petkim to help cut Turkey’s dependence on imports of refined oil products. It will boost the country’s refining capacity by 25-30 percent. “Initial consumption (of oil) will be 100,000 barrels per day with a further increase to 215,000 bpd,” Adnan Ahmadzadeh, SOCAR Trading executive chairman, said in answers to Reuters questions sent by email. “SOCAR Trading will supply oil (to STAR) from different producers at ports in the Mediterranean, Black Sea and Persian Gulf, as well as from Russian company Rosneft.” He said the company had secured contracts to buy А-92 grade gasoline from producers in Russia, Switzerland and Turkmenistan due to planned maintenance at the Azeri Heydar Aliyev refinery in the capital Baku. Russia and Swiss company Vitol have provided around 30,000 tonnes of gasoline each, while around 5,000-10,000 tonnes will be shipped from Turkmenistan. GLOBAL PLAYER Geneva-based SOCAR Trading was set up in 2007 and has become a global player in the last few years, having previously been only a marketer of its country’s crude, Azeri Light. Poaching top traders from established rivals, it moved into paper trading and third-party oil. Ahmadzadeh said oil was still “playing a central role” in the firm’s trading strategy, having a 50 percent share in its portfolio. The firm last year traded 1.54 million bpd of crude oil, of which about 1.06 million bpd was from third parties, it said in July. Combining crude and oil products, it traded 104 million tonnes. The firm also started trading liquefied natural gas in 2017. Ahmadzadeh said the company had decided to reduce the share of fuel oil - recently at 30 percent - in its trading portfolio. “The strategic decision has been made, but it will start to reflect on figures in 2019,” he said. Ahmadzadeh said SOCAR Trading was open to discussions on obtaining crude from Russia’s Filanovsky and Rakushechnoye oilfields in the Caspian Sea operated by Russian company Lukoil , with shipment via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline. “We are ready for dialogue on these oilfields and don’t see any problems from a technical viewpoint on getting these oil flows,” he said. Ahmadzadeh said the company would soon start selling polypropylene and low-pressure polyethylene from SOCAR’s polymer plant, which started operating in August. The main export markets will be Turkey, Europe, China and India. As for the fertiliser carbamide (urea), which is expected to be produced at a plant in the city of Sumgait in 2019, exports will focus on Turkey, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Greece, Israel and Italy. Annual production is estimated at 600,000 tonnes. (Writing by Margarita Antidze; editing by Vladimir Soldatkin and Dale Hudson)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
2018-09-14,https://www.reuters.com,"In shift, Pakistani giant Engro to bet big on rising middle class","KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan’s chemicals-to-energy conglomerate Engro Corp has seen its fortunes rise on the back of massive Chinese investment, but plans to shape its future growth around the country’s vast population and expanding middle class, its chief executive said.     The logo of Engro Corporation is seen at office in Karachi, Pakistan September 10, 2018.  REUTERS/Akhtar SoomroEngro Corp (EGCH.KA), best known for its fertilizer and petrochemicals factories, as well as engineering projects, is Pakistan’s largest listed conglomerate, and after recovering from a brush with bankruptcy in the early part of this decade is now sitting on a $500 million cash pile.  It has been a major beneficiary from Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative splurge, working with Chinese firms on coal and power projects worth billions of dollars.     Engro’s rising fortunes since 2012, when its factories were crippled by gas shortages, mirror the improvements in Pakistan, a nuclear-armed nation where economic growth has accelerated due to vast Chinese investment and a sharp drop in militancy and power outages.     In the near term, Engro’s outlook is linked to a mile-long $1.5 billion coal mine in the Thar desert near the border with India, part of Beijing’s pledge to invest about $60 billion in Pakistan. But with Pakistan’s new government hinting it may review Belt and Road contracts due to concerns they were too expensive, some analysts see risks on the horizon for Engro and say planned power plants around the mine may struggle to obtain financing. Ghias Khan, Engro’s chief executive, told Reuters this week he was “pretty confident” the government would not re-open deals with sovereign guarantees.     “If they do, that will have a very negative impact,” Khan said. This year Pakistan’s economy has also been shaken by a shortage of dollars, and speculation Islamabad may turn to the International Monetary Fund to ease current account pressures. CONSUMER GROWTH Undeterred by Chinese investment jitters and the recently wobbly economy, Khan said Engro was weighing acquisitions and starting new businesses in agriculture, healthcare, real estate, communications and other consumer-linked sectors to profit from rising incomes in the Muslim majority country of 208 million people, 60 percent of whom are aged under 30.     “We’ve come to a realization what has gotten Engro where it is today is not good enough for our next phase of growth,” Khan said in an interview at Engro’s ocean-front headquarters in Karachi, an Arabian Sea metropolis.     Slideshow (2 Images)“What we are proud of is our ability to execute large-scale projects and put up large industrial complexes. But we are mindful we have to get into businesses which are more related to the population growth, and take us closer to the consumers.”          In Karachi, mushrooming shopping malls and ever-rising number of cars on the road point to a multi-year consumer boom as people’s disposable incomes have doubled this decade, analysts say.     Khan compared Pakistan’s current economic level, population growth and per capita income, which stands at about $1,600, to where China, South Korea and India were at earlier points in their development.     “If you look at sectors that did well when they were where Pakistan is today ... like real estate, automobiles, healthcare, logistics - everything is somehow related or linked to  population growth or the middle class,” Khan said.        COAL BONANZA?     The company, born out of an employees’ buyout of Exxon’s Pakistan operations in the 1990s, was also looking to go deeper into the petrochemicals sector, and was exploring projects to set up naphtha, ethane crackers or polypropylene facilities in the ports of Karachi or Gwadar, Khan added.      What Engro will do with its cash pile of about 60 billion rupees ($490 million) has been a hot topic in Pakistan’s equity market.     “One thing is very clear: how we invest these 60 billion rupees ... will determine how this organization looks 10-15 years from now,” said Khan, adding a decision would be made “hopefully soon”.     In the meantime, the company is busily expanding its coal projects in Thar, located in the remote deserts of Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital. Helped by Beijing’s cash and Chinese expertise, Engro began digging the Thar mine in 2016 with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC).  The coal will feed into a 660MW power plant Engro is building, part of about 4,000MW of generation planned by various Pakistani consortiums by 2021. Pakistan says it has the world’s 7th largest coal reserves, but it is of the low-grade lignite variety and for decades successive attempts at large-scale mining have failed.     Analysts say Engro has locked in returns on equity of about 30 percent per annum, in dollar terms and with a sovereign guarantee, on the power projects.     Engro declined to reveal equity returns on power projects, but with Pakistan looking to control its ballooning current account deficit to avoid another IMF bailout, Khan said the new government was likely to want power plants that do not rely on imported fuel.

2018-09-25,https://www.reuters.com,Total finalizes plans to expand Texas Bayport Polymers in petrochems push,"PARIS (Reuters) - French oil and gas major Total has made a final investment decision to expand its Texas Bayport Polymers joint venture to double polyethylene production capacity to around 1.1 million tonnes a year, the company said. The logo of French oil giant Total is seen at La Defense business and financial district in Courbevoie, near Paris, France. May 16, 2018.  REUTERS/Charles Platiau Total said it aimed to become a major player in the U.S. polyethylene market when it announced the joint venture in March 2017 with Borealis and Canada’s Nova Chemical. The Bayport project is in line with the company’s $3 billion program that began a year ago with a $1.7 billion investment to build an ethane steam cracker at its Port Arthur refining complex in Texas. The cracker will process ethane, which is abundantly available from U.S shale gas at competitive prices, and will supply Bayport polyethylene units. Production is expected to start in 2021. The new unit is expected to have a capacity of a 625,000 tonnes a year, that will added to the existing 400,000 tonnes per year unit.  The Bayport unit engineering, procurement and construction has been awarded to the company McDermott, Total said. Polyethylene is used in packaging, pipes, bottles, plastics and other composite materials. It is also seen as a growing market, that Total is targeting with a global expansion of its petrochemicals refining units. “The project is in line with our strategy to develop petrochemicals at our major integrated (refining) complexes and leverage competitively priced feedstocks,” said Bernard Pinatel, Total’s President for Refining and Chemicals. Pinatel said light materials are increasingly used as substitutes for metals in various industrial sectors such as transport and energy, all of which is lifting demand for plastics and polymers.  “It is a market that is growing by 3 to 4 percent per year,” Pinatel said. As part of this expansion into the polyethylene market, Total and Saudi Aramco had said in April they would invest around $5 billion to build a petrochemical complex at their Jubail Satorp refinery.  In May, Total also signed a $1.5 billion deal with Algeria’s Sonatrach to build a polypropylene plant in western Algeria that will supply plastic to the Algerian and wider Mediterranean market.  Last December, its South Korean joint venture with Hanwha Group had also said it would invest $331 million in the group’s refining and petrochemicals platform to increase polyethylene output by 400,000 tonnes per year by 2019. That increased investment was planned to deal with growing demand, particularly from China.  Reporting by Bate Felix; Editing by Sudip Kar-GuptaOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

Braskem CEO Fernando Musa said the current five-year supply contract, which is one of the largest held by Braskem with state-controlled Petrobras, ends in 2020. Petrobras sells 7 million tonnes of naphtha to Braskem annually, Musa said. “We don’t want to start the negotiation too close to the deadline,” he told journalists. Musa said the company has supply contracts abroad that may reach up to 20 years. Musa said he expects Braskem’s U.S. unit to begin operations in its new polypropylene production unit in La Porte, Texas, in 2020. The company last year said the final phase of main construction on the new unit, which will be located next to its existing production facilities, was targeted for the first quarter of 2020. Musa said Braskem will try to lead groups vying for the two refining companies in the northeast and southern Brazil that Petrobras plans to sell. He declined to comment on the company’s previously announced project to unify its different share classes into a single common stock.

The Saudi index, which had tumbled 7.2 percent over the previous two trading days because of concern the Khashoggi case could trigger U.S. sanctions against Riyadh and shrink inflows of foreign investment, rebounded 2.2 percent in the first half-hour on Monday. Petrochemical firms that had led the declines were particularly strong on Monday. The Gulf’s biggest petrochemical producer, Saudi Basic Industries, jumped 4.4 percent. Sahara Petrochemical rose 5.1 percent after saying a unit had started marketing polypropylene made by affiliate Al-Waha Petrochemicals in the region.

2018-10-15,https://www.reuters.com,MIDEAST STOCKS-Saudi rebounds from Khashoggi slide as institutions buy,"* Saudi recovers Sunday’s sharp losses * Institutional investors buy shares actively * Some say government may have mounted support operation * Oman’s market falls after bank earnings * Egypt’s Madinet continues surge on share swap plan By Abinaya Vijayaraghavan Oct 15 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s stock market rebounded sharply on Monday from losses suffered in the wake of the disappearance of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as local institutions bought shares actively. The Saudi index - which had plunged 7.2 percent in the previous two days on fears that Khashoggi’s case could trigger U.S. sanctions against Riyadh and shrink inflows of foreign investment - jumped 4.1 percent in heavy trade, erasing Sunday’s losses. A Saudi treasury banker said he believed the rebound was aided by government-linked funds intervening to support the market, as they did late last year when a corruption inquiry unsettled investors. But Saudi-based analyst Khaled Feda said the market had overreacted to the Khashoggi case on Sunday, creating attractive opportunities to purchase blue chips. Foreign investors were keen buyers on Monday, he said. The banker said investors were encouraged by news that King Salman had ordered an internal investigation into Khashoggi’s disappearance after he visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, which could hasten the process of resolving the crisis. Turkish officials allege Saudi agents killed Khashoggi, which Riyadh denies. The Saudi rial fell to its lowest level against the dollar in the spot market for two years on Monday, while Riyadh’s international bond prices slipped. But the drops were much smaller than some bouts of instability caused by low oil prices in the last several years. Petrochemical and bank stocks lifted the index. The Gulf’s biggest petrochemical producer, Saudi Basic Industries , rose 3.7 percent. Sahara Petrochemical added 6.9 percent after saying a unit had started marketing polypropylene made by affiliate Al-Waha Petrochemicals in the region. Saudi Industrial Export jumped 10 percent as trade in the rights to its equity issue began. Meanwhile, Oman’s index dropped 0.8 percent after a slew of corporate earnings from its banks. Bank Muscat slid 1.9 percent despite reporting a rise in profit for the nine months ended Sept. 30. Al Anwar Ceramic Tiles dropped 5.9 percent after its profits fell during the same period. The Egyptian blue-chip index shed 0.1 percent but Madinet Nasr for Housing and Development jumped 7.7 percent, continuing a surge that began on Sunday when Sixth of October Development and Investment (SODIC) said it aimed to take over Madinet by exchanging one of its shares for two Madinet shares. Arqaam Capital said the ratio was more favourable than expected for shareholders in Madinet; SODIC plunged nearly 10 percent on Monday. In Dubai, the index edged down 0.03 percent as real estate and industrial shares reversed early gains to trade lower. Qatar’s index was up 0.1 percent on a 2.7 percent rise in Industries Qatar and a 0.4 percent increase in Qatar Electricity and Water after it signed a 15-year service agreement with Japan’s Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems for 360 million riyals ($96 million).

2018-10-17,https://www.reuters.com,Turkmenistan opens $3.4 bln chemicals plant,"KIYANLY, Turkmenistan, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Turkmenistan opened a $3.4 billion chemicals plant on Wednesday built by Japan’s TOYO Engineering and South Korea’s LG International and Hyundai Engineering, in a bid to diversify an economy dependent on gas exports. Using natural gas - of which Turkmenistan has the world’s fourth-biggest reserves - as feedstock, the plant will produce up to 386,000 tonnes of polyethylene and 81,000 tonnes of polypropylene a year. The Central Asian nation, whose economy has been hit hard by a slump in gas export revenue, borrowed from Japan’s JBIC and Korea’s K-exim to finance construction of the plant on its Caspian coast from where it can be shipped abroad.

2018-10-26,https://www.reuters.com,"UPDATE 1-S-Oil sees Q4 refining margins rise on seasonal demand, tight supply","* Sees favourable margins in Q4 on heating oil demand * New refining, petchem units to start commercial operations in Nov * Expects new unit start-up to support Q4 earnings * Q3 operating profit 316 bln won vs 553 bln won year earlier (Adds comments, details, graphic) By Jane Chung SEOUL, Oct 26 (Reuters) - South Korea’s S-Oil Corp said on Friday it expected fourth quarter refining margins to rise on higher seasonal demand and tight regional supply and with the start of its new refining and petrochemical plants supporting earnings. Singapore refining margins DUB-SIN-REF, the benchmark profits for Asian oil processors, rose to $7.99 a barrel on Aug. 15, the highest since margins rebounded in July, supported by rising demand for gasoline and jet fuel. The profits from refining a barrel of benchmark Dubai crude into fuel currently stands at $5.23 a barrel. Asian gasoil margins hit their highest in more than three years on Wednesday, pushed higher by lower supplies in region and expectations for increased gasoil demand as consumers move to meet stricter marine fuel regulations. “The seasonal demand growth and limited capacity expansions in Asia Pacific will further boost the refining margin,” the refiner, whose top shareholder is Saudi Aramco, said in an earnings statement. The company said heating oil demand will increase refining margins as winter approaches. S-Oil posted a 42.9 percent decline in operating profit to 316 billion won ($277.67 million) for the July-September period, due to reduced inventory-related gains and despite improved refining margins. Operating profit was down from 553 billion won in the same period a year earlier. The company also said its new residue fuel oil and olefin plants, known as the residue upgrading complex and olefin downstream complex (ODC), are expected to begin commercial operations in November. The new units will churn out 405,000 tonnes per annum (TPA) of polypropylene, 300,000 TPA of propylene oxide, and 21,000 barrels per day of gasoline. “Commercial operations of the RUC-ODC project are expected to contribute to Q4 earnings .... (their) stable operations are secured at maximum designed capacity,” company treasurer Shin Kwan-bae said in a call with analysts. Shares of S-Oil were down 3.5 percent by 0207 GMT after the earnings announcement, while the wider market was 1.1 percent lower.
